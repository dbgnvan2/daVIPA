"""VPS editor and planning screen — the structure two old bug fixes depend on.

BC3. Converted from a standalone script: every test returned a bool inside
``except Exception: return False``, so pytest ignored the verdict and an
exception read as a pass. None of these four were lying at the time of the
conversion — unlike ``test_vps_segments``, which was — but none of them could
have told us if they started.

The two fixes these guard:
  * the New Vision crash — `CTkMessageBox` replaced with tkinter's `messagebox`
  * segment selection on the planning screen — `selected_segments`

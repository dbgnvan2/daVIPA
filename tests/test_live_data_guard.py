"""No test may reach the user's real application database.

Purpose: prove the three layers of isolation actually fire, rather than
         assuming them.
Spec:    docs/unused-docs/implementation_plan_2026-08-19_backlog_clearance.md
Tests:   this file

The incident (`3892159`): ``test_obsidian_dialogs.py::test_database`` called
``DatabaseManager()`` with no path. That resolves to the user's real
application database, and ``__init__`` calls ``initialize_schema()`` —
migrations, the Weekly Tactic dedupe (which deletes rows) and the invariant
repair (which moves dates). Every full-suite run opened production data for
months. Nothing failed, because nothing was checking.

Three layers now stand between a test and that file, and each covers a hole the
others leave:

1. ``pytest_sessionstart`` points ``GETMOREDONE_DB`` at a temp file, so the
   *default* no longer resolves to production. An environment variable has one
   identity, so it cannot be defeated the way a patched class can.
2. ``_forbid_resolving_the_real_database`` raises inside ``resolve_db_path``,
   so an escape names the offending line instead of surfacing later as a
   changed file.
3. ``pytest_sessionfinish`` fingerprints the real files and reports a mismatch,
   which catches anything that bypassed both — the artifact check that does not
   depend on any patch holding (P6).

This file asserts that layers 1 and 2 are live and can fail, and that no test
constructs a database manager without a path.

"""BP4 — code retired because nothing in the app called it.

Spec: docs/unused-docs/implementation_plan_2026-08-19_backlog_clearance.md#bp4

``complete_and_create`` and ``RescheduleDialog`` each had no caller in ``src/``.
Both had been kept alive by their own tests, which is how an unreachable path
goes on collecting maintenance — the weekly-lineage work hardened
``complete_and_create`` twice for a path no user could reach.

These assertions exist so the names cannot quietly return without a caller: a
grep, because the point is the absence of a definition, and no behavioural test
can assert that.

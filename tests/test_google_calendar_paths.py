"""Where GoogleCalendarManager looks for its credentials, and what it creates.

Purpose: constructing the manager must read its arguments before it touches the
         filesystem, and the three sites that resolve a default path must all
         resolve to the same one.
Spec:    docs/unused-docs/implementation_plan_2026-08-19_backlog_clearance.md#batch-3
Tests:   this file

BI3. ``__init__`` used to run::

    self.data_dir = Path.home() / ".getmoredone"
    self.data_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

*before* looking at ``credentials_file`` / ``token_file``, so merely
constructing the object with two explicit paths created a folder in the real
home directory that nothing then used. Tests worked around it by redirecting
``Path.home()``; ``tests/test_first_run.py`` asserted the workaround.

Two rules govern every test here:

* **Never reach the network.** ``__init__`` ends in ``_authenticate()``, which
  runs a real OAuth flow when it finds a usable credentials file. Every
  construction below points at a path that does not exist, so ``_authenticate``
  raises ``FileNotFoundError`` before it builds a flow.
* **Never assert against the real home directory.** A test that checks
  ``~/.getmoredone`` is absent fails on any machine where the user genuinely
  has one — this developer's machine included. The home directory is redirected
  and the assertions are made against the redirected one.

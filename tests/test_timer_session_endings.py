"""The three ways a timer session can end, exercised through the real modals.

Purpose: T1 — "Save Related - Close Timer" wrote its work log and left the
         window on screen. Every test in tests/test_reward_protocol_timer.py
         stubs CompletionNoteDialog out, and the modal is the *only* thing that
         differs between Save Related (which failed to close) and Cancel (which
         closed), so the defect had no way to fail a test.
Spec:    docs/unused-docs/implementation_plan_2026-08-25_timer_session_endings.md#acceptance-criteria
Tests:   this file

These build real TimerWindows on a real DatabaseManager, withdrawn like every
other window in the suite. They were written against the ``mapped_windows``
fixture on the assumption that grab_set() needs a viewable window — it does,
but conftest silences grab_set() for the whole run, so nothing here ever
called it. Sixteen tests that skip on the machine people iterate on is a poor
trade for a precondition that was never required; measured by removing the
fixture and re-running every mutation.

-topmost is read and written through ``window.tk.call`` rather than
``window.attributes``, past the patch conftest uses to keep always-on-top
windows off the user's desktop — otherwise these would be measuring conftest.

"""No test in this suite may be incapable of failing.

Purpose: keep the suite honest about its own coverage.
Spec:    docs/unused-docs/implementation_plan_2026-08-19_backlog_clearance.md
Tests:   this file

A test that returns a bool, has no check in its body, or asserts a literal is
green forever — including when the thing it protects has been dead for months.
It is invisible precisely because the suite looks healthy: the count goes up,
the colour stays green, and the coverage is imaginary.

`3892159` fixed sixteen of them across four files. One,
``test_enhanced_deletion_protection``, was ``return False`` — a *failing* test
reporting green — over segment-deletion protection that had been dead since
``delete_segment``'s return shape changed. Nothing could tell.

This is a static check on purpose, and it is one of the few places where that
is the right answer: a vacuous test cannot be detected by running it. Running
it is what produces the false green.

"""Session count and total time on the Project record.

Purpose: PT1-PT3 — how many timer sessions a project has absorbed and how long
         they came to. Both derived from work_logs rather than stored, because a
         counter column is a status field that can disagree with the rows it
         summarises (P6).
Spec:    docs/unused-docs/implementation_plan_2026-08-25_project_time_totals.md#acceptance-criteria
Tests:   this file

ProjectBoard.savor_count is a different quantity — completed deliverables, used
only to pick the reward phase — and carries no time.

"""WT-M7.A — merge duplicate Weekly Tactics; WT-M7.B — repair the invariants.

Spec: docs/spec_2026-08-18_weekly_tactic_scheduling.md#wt-m7

The live database holds exactly one duplicate: APE ``ape-f28e63eb``, week
2026-02-23, where the *older* row is titled ``W8`` and holds all five children,
and the *newer* row is titled ``W9`` and holds one reschedule_history row.
2026-02-23 is ISO 2026-W9, so keeping the oldest and its title would preserve a
wrong number (WT-F5). Both halves of that are tested here.

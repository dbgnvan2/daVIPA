"""BP6 — a related Action Item is titled what the user typed.

Spec: docs/unused-docs/implementation_plan_2026-08-19_backlog_clearance.md#bp6

The Weekly Items screen used to compose ``<tactic context> - <title>``. No
screen has offered a Context field for some time, and ``lineage_for_item``
resolves an item's segment/subsegment/category from its Annual Plan Element
first and its parent second — the title prefix is only the third choice, and
these rows carry both of the first two. So the prefix changed what got stored
without changing anything the app reads.

The lineage assertions matter more than the title one: the title change is only
safe because lineage never depended on it, and that is what these tests pin.

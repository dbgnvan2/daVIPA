"""Renaming must never break a link.

Purpose: a name is a label, never the thing that holds two rows together.
Spec:    docs/spec_2026-08-19_rename_safe_links.md
Plan:    docs/unused-docs/implementation_plan_2026-08-19_rename_safe_links.md
Tests:   this file

RN-M2.D is the whole spec as one test and is written **first**, red. It fails
today at three of six rename levels. That is the acceptance criterion for the
change, not a bug in the test — do not weaken it to get an early green.

The failure it encodes, measured (spec §2): renaming a segment makes an
ordinary date change on a filed Action Item **raise**, and the item silently
does not move, because the re-filing cascade resolves the segment by name.

    The decision is a comparison of two SETS, not a boolean: the segments the
    OLD name collided with, and the ones the NEW name collides with. A save is
    refused when the second set contains an id the first did not — that id is
    a segment being newly broken.

    Every cheaper formulation has failed here. "Is there a collision" froze
    every row of a pre-existing pair. "Did the name change", asked in Python,
    let a non-ASCII re-case create one. "Did the old name collide" disabled
    the guard for the whole save, so a collided row could rename a clean third
    segment into a collision and permanently break a row nobody touched.

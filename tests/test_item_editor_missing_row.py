"""The editor must not report success for a row that no longer exists.

Spec: docs/implementation_plan_2026-08-19_backlog_clearance.md#bp3

`ItemEditorDialog.__init__` does `self.item = db_manager.get_action_item(item_id)`
and leaves `item_id` set when that returns None — the row was deleted from a
list, or from a second editor window, while this one was open.

Before BP3 that state raised `AttributeError` inside `save_item`, which the
`except` turned into a visible "Error: …". BP3's shared builder fabricates a
brand-new `ActionItem` when handed `None`, the save then took the *update*
branch, and `update_action_item` returns True for a row it did not match — so
the editor said "Saved", closed, and discarded every edit (P2: a failure that
reports success; P12: a refactor that turned a loud failure into a silent one).

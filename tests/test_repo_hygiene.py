"""Repo hygiene tests.

Purpose: keep the repository root readable as a product, and stop a required
         resource being silently excluded from the distribution.
Spec:    docs/spec_2026-08-18_downloadable_release.md#r-m7
Tests:   this file

R-M7.B is the important one. `.gitignore` carries a blanket `*.json` rule with
a handful of `!` exceptions. That is the same shape as finding F1: a resource
the app loads at runtime can be excluded from the repo — and therefore from
every build — without anybody noticing, because the app keeps working on the
machine where the untracked file still exists locally.

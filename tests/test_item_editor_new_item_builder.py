"""BP3 — one builder assembles a new Action Item, whichever button saves it.

Spec: docs/unused-docs/implementation_plan_2026-08-19_backlog_clearance.md#bp3

``save_item`` (the Save button) and ``save_item_if_needed`` ("Create Note",
"Link Note", the calendar dialog) both insert a brand-new row. They used to
assemble its fields separately and had already drifted twice — the Project
link, then the order in which the Annual Plan Element is written. These tests
compare the two rows field by field on a fully-populated form, so a third drift
fails here rather than in the app.

Real dialogs on a real DatabaseManager: a stub cannot show that a control which
renders is actually reaching the database (P25).

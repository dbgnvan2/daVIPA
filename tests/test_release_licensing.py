"""Licensing tests for the downloadable release.

Purpose: keep GPL-licensed code out of a proprietary, source-available binary.
Spec:    docs/spec_2026-08-18_downloadable_release.md#r-m2b3
Tests:   this file

Finding F2: ``tkcalendar`` is GPLv3. Shipping it inside a binary distributed
under the proprietary license of decision D1 would violate the GPL. Finding F3:
``pygame`` is LGPL, which *is* permissible in a proprietary product provided the
user can relink it — hence the one-folder packaging asserted in
``tests/test_packaging_resources.py::test_rm1d_spec_uses_onefolder_not_onefile``.

So the rule these tests encode is narrow and deliberate: **LGPL is allowed, GPL
and AGPL are not.** The second test walks the whole installed dependency tree
rather than naming tkcalendar, so a *future* GPL dependency is caught too
(meta-rule: fix the class, not the instance).

R-M2.A (LICENSE exists), R-M2.C (third-party notices) and R-M2.D (no audio
committed) are covered below as of Phase 5.

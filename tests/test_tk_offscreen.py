A full run builds real Tk windows on purpose — that is the only way to prove a
control is wired to the database rather than merely rendered (P25). On macOS
each of those appears, raises itself and grabs the keyboard, so a run threw
dozens of modals over whatever the user was doing.

They are withdrawn on creation, and the calls that would pull one back —
``lift``, ``focus_force``, ``grab_set`` — are no-ops for the run. Moving them
off-screen instead does not work on macOS, which clamps a window back onto the
display. The few tests that read real geometry ask for the ``mapped_windows``
fixture, because ``winfo_width()`` on a withdrawn window returns 1.

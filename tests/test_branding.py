"""The displayed name comes from one constant, and the data path does not.

Purpose: a rebrand must be a value change, not a hunt across three files —
         and it must NOT drag the user-data directory along with it.
Spec:    docs/daVIPA_rebrand_prompt.md
Tests:   this file

The window title, the sidebar wordmark and the --selftest banner each held
their own copy of the name. These assert that changing the constant changes
all three, so the next rename cannot leave one behind.

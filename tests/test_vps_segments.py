"""VPS Segment management — Settings controls, colour validation, deletion guard.

BC3. This file used to be a standalone script renamed into the suite. Every
test was wrapped in ``except Exception: return False`` and returned a bool
instead of asserting, so pytest ignored the verdict and reported green whatever
happened — including an exception. Several checks only printed a ``⚠`` and
carried on, so they could not fail at all.

That was not theoretical. ``test_enhanced_deletion_protection`` **was returning
False**: `delete_segment` had moved from a `vision_count` int to a `counts`
dict, and the test that existed to guard it went on passing. It was checking
the source text for a name that no longer existed.

Rewritten to assert, and to exercise behaviour rather than grep source wherever
that is cheap.

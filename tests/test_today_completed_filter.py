"""BC1 — Today shows only what belongs to today.

BACKLOG.md carried "Today listing shows all completed items (should only show
today's)" as an open bug. It is not open: both paths in
``TodayScreen.get_todays_items`` restrict completed items to
``DATE(completed_at) = today``. Verified against a real database rather than
read off the source, then pinned here — the entry survived because nothing
asserted the behaviour either way.

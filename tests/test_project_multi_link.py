"""BP1/BP2 — an Action Item belongs to exactly one Project.

Spec: docs/unused-docs/implementation_plan_2026-08-19_backlog_clearance.md#bp1

The Projects screen's "link existing items" dialog was the last additive
surface. Making it exclusive means it can now *delete* links, so the tests here
are as much about what must **not** happen without consent as about the link
that is written (P2 — never silently drop).

The dialog methods are driven with SimpleNamespace stubs against a **real**
DatabaseManager, the pattern used by tests/test_item_editor_project_link.py, so
a control that renders but never reaches the database fails here (P25).

## Quick Start

### Download a build (recommended)

Grab the archive for your system from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/dbgnvan2/daVIPA/releases):

| System | File |
|---|---|
| macOS | `daVIPA-mac.zip` |
| Windows | `daVIPA-win64.zip` |

**macOS needs one extra step on first launch.** The build is unsigned, so macOS
blocks it. On **macOS 15 (Sequoia) and later**, let it get blocked, then go to
**System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**. Control-clicking
the app and choosing Open no longer works — Apple removed that in macOS 15.

Or skip the clicking on any version:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/daVIPA.app
```

Full instructions, checksum verification, and where your data is stored are in
**[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.

No Linux build — run from source instead.

### Run from source

### One-Command Startup (Recommended)

**Linux/Mac:**

```bash
./start.sh
```

**Windows:**

```cmd
start.bat
```

The startup script automatically:

- Creates virtual environment (if needed)
- Activates the environment
- Installs/updates dependencies
- Launches the application

### A demo instance alongside your real one

```bash
./start-demo.sh
```

Runs a second, fully isolated instance — its own database, settings, lock and
logs under `~/Library/Application Support/GetMoreDone-Demo/` — seeded with
sample items on its first launch, while the installed app keeps running on your
real data. See [docs/DEMO_INSTALL.md](docs/DEMO_INSTALL.md).

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to run commands individually:

#### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# ...or, to run the tests as well (this includes requirements.txt):
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

#### 2. Create Demo Data (Optional)

```bash
python tools/create_demo_data.py
```

#### 3. Run Application

```bash
python run.py
```

Or alternatively:

```bash
python -m getmoredone
```

## Usage Guide

### Managing Contacts

1. Go to **Contacts** screen
2. Click **"+ New Contact"** to add a client or contact
3. Fill in: Name (required), Type (Client/Contact/Personal), Email, Phone, Notes
4. Click on any contact to edit or deactivate
5. Contacts appear in WHO field autocomplete when creating items

### Creating Items

1. Click **"+ New Item"** from any screen
2. **Who field**: Type to search contacts, or click + to add new contact inline
3. Required fields: **Who** (client/person) and **Title**
4. Optional: Description, dates, priority factors, organization, planned time
5. Priority score auto-calculates: I × U × S × V

### Item Editor Buttons

When editing an existing item, you have several action buttons:

- **Save** - Saves changes and keeps the window open (shows "✓ Saved" confirmation)
- **Save & Close** - Saves changes and closes the window
- **Save + New** - (New items only) Saves, closes, and opens a blank editor
- **Duplicate** - Saves current changes, then opens the duplicate in a NEW window
- **Create Follow-up** - Creates a new item linked to current, with dates +1 day
- **Create Tasks** - Creates child items from Next Action field (one per line)
- **Complete** - Marks item as complete and closes
- **📅 Calendar** - Creates a Google Calendar event

### Creating Child Tasks

To break down a task into sub-tasks:

1. Open an existing item in the editor
2. Add tasks to the **Next Action** field, one per line. Example:
   ```
   Design homepage
   Write product copy
   Set up payment system
   Test checkout flow
   ```
3. Click **"+ Create Tasks"** button
4. Creates one child item for each line with:
   - Title: "Parent Title - Task text"
   - Description: The task text
   - Same dates, priority, and other fields as parent
   - Parent-child relationship established

### Deleting Items

1. **From Item Editor**: Open an item and click the red **Delete** button (bottom right)
2. **Confirmation**: Dialog asks you to confirm deletion
3. **Child Items**: If the item has children:
   - A warning dialog appears showing the number of child items
   - Children are **NOT deleted** - they become root items (parent_id set to NULL)
   - You can still proceed with deletion or cancel
4. **Cascading**: Related data is handled automatically:
   - Work logs: Deleted with the item
   - Links (notes, URLs): Deleted with the item
   - Reschedule history: Deleted with the item
   - Child items: **Preserved** and become root items
5. **No Undo**: Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone

### Priority Factors

- **Importance**: Critical (20), High (10), Medium (5), Low (1)
- **Urgency**: Critical (20), High (10), Medium (5), Low (1)
- **Effort-Cost**: XL (16), L (8), M (4), S (2)
- **Value**: XL (16), L (8), M (4), S (2)

### Working with Hierarchical Tasks

1. **Create a sub-item**: Open any existing item and click **"+ Create Sub-Item"**
   - Sub-item is created as a **duplicate** of the parent (all fields copied)
   - Includes: WHO, title, description, dates, priority factors, group, category, planned time
   - Parent relationship is automatically set (parent_id)
   - Edit the sub-item to customize as needed
2. **Navigate hierarchy**: Click "View Parent" button on sub-items to go up
3. **Hierarchical View**: Click **Hierarchical** in sidebar to see full tree structure
   - Shows parent-child relationships with visual indentation
   - Displays child count for parent items
   - Filter by status (open/completed/all)
4. **Multi-level nesting**: Create grandchildren by adding sub-items to sub-items

### Setting Defaults

1. Go to **Defaults** screen
2. Choose **System Defaults** (apply to all) or **Who-specific** (per client)
3. Set priority factors, group, category, planned minutes
4. Precedence: Manual entry > Who defaults > System defaults

### Using the Action Timer

The Action Timer helps you stay focused on tasks with countdown timing, break management, and productivity tracking.

**Starting a Timer:**

1. Click the **"⏱ Timer"** button on any open action item — found in TODAY, Upcoming, and All Items, and in the **Edit Action Item** window (there it saves your edits first, then opens the timer so it reflects the current time block and notes)
2. The timer window opens showing:
   - **Time Block**: Total allocated time (e.g., 30 minutes)
   - **Time To Finish**: Countdown for work time (e.g., 25 minutes)
   - **Wrap/Break**: Break duration (e.g., 5 minutes)
   - **Next Steps**: Shows the action item's description to help you get started
   - **Currently Playing**: Track name from your music folder (if configured)
3. Optionally edit the Time Block value before starting
4. Click **Start** to begin the countdown (background music starts automatically — from your configured folder, or the app's built-in tracks if you haven't set one)

**Timer Controls:**

- **Start**: Begin countdown (required click, doesn't auto-start)
- **Pause/Resume**: Pause work time (elapsed time continues, work time pauses)
- **Stop**: End the timer session (shows Finished/Continue buttons)
- **Close Window**: Same as clicking Stop

**Music Controls (Independent):**

- **🎵 Play**: Start or resume music playback (purple button)
- **⏸ Pause**: Pause or resume music (purple button, changes to "▶ Resume" when paused)
- **Independent Operation**: Music controls work separately from timer controls
  - Pausing the timer does NOT pause the music
  - You can control music anytime without affecting the timer
  - Music only stops when you click Stop or close the window
- **If nothing plays**: the window tells you why — "No music folder set…", "No playable music in …", or "♫ *track*". Set a folder in **Settings → Timer & Audio**, or leave it blank to use the app's built-in tracks. Supported formats: MP3, WAV, OGG, AIFF (FLAC/M4A/AAC may vary by system).

**Visual Indicators:**

- Title bar shows time remaining (e.g., "Task Name - 12:34")
- When < 10 minutes remaining: Time turns **green** as a warning
- During break time: Title shows "BREAK" in **blue** with break countdown
- Window is always-on-top and resizable
- Position and size are saved between sessions

**Completion Options (after Stop):**

**Finished Workflow:**

1. Click **Finished** button
2. Enter optional completion note describing what you accomplished
3. Timer saves a work log entry with actual work time (excluding pauses)
4. Action item is marked as completed
5. Timer window closes

**Continue Workflow** (for ongoing multi-day tasks):

1. Click **Continue** button
2. Enter optional completion note for today's work
3. Enter optional next steps note and **select dates** for the continued action:
   - Next Steps Note: Text describing what to do next
   - Start Date: When to start the next action (default: tomorrow)
   - Due Date: When it's due (default: tomorrow)
   - Quick buttons: "Today" and "+1" to adjust dates
   - Validation: Due date must be >= Start date
4. Current action is marked as completed with work log
5. New duplicate action is created with your selected dates:
   - Same title, priority, who, category, group
   - Start and due dates as you specified
   - Description updated with next steps note
6. New action opens in editor for review

**Time Tracking:**

- **Work Time**: Actual productive time (excludes pauses), saved to work log
- **Elapsed Time**: Total wall clock time from start to stop
- Work logs are viewable in the action item's history

**Break Time:**

- Automatically calculated: Work Time = Time Block - Break Time
- Default: 30 min block = 25 min work + 5 min break
- Break countdown starts automatically when work time reaches 00:00
- You can click Finished/Continue during break (no need to wait)
- Break time is not optional (but you can ignore it and finish early)

**Music Playback:**

- **Independent Controls**: Separate Play/Pause buttons (purple) for music control
- **Background Music**: Plays random tracks from your configured music folder during work sessions
- **Manual Control**: Start/pause music anytime without affecting the timer state
- **Continuous Playback**: Music continues playing even when timer is paused
- **Track Display**: Currently playing track name shown in status (♫ Track Name)
- **Volume Control**: Adjustable volume slider in Settings > Timer & Audio (0-100%)
- **Supported Formats**: MP3, WAV, OGG (best compatibility)
- **Format Conversion**: Use `tools/convert_music_to_mp3.py` script to convert M4A/AAC/WMA/FLAC to MP3
- **Configuration**: Set music folder path in Settings > Timer & Audio

**Audio Alerts:**

- **Break Start Sound**: Plays when work time ends and break begins
- **Break End Sound**: Plays when break time expires
- Sounds are **optional** - can be enabled/disabled in Settings
- Custom WAV files can be specified in Settings
- Falls back to system beep if no custom sound specified
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Settings:**

- **Default Time Block**: 30 minutes (editable in Settings > Timer & Audio)
- **Default Break Time**: 5 minutes (editable in Settings > Timer & Audio)
- **Warning Time**: Green warning appears at < 10 minutes (editable in Settings > Timer & Audio)
- **Enable Break Sounds**: Toggle audio alerts on/off
- **Break Start Sound**: Path to custom WAV file (optional)
- **Break End Sound**: Path to custom WAV file (optional)
- **Music Folder**: Path to folder containing music files for timer playback
- **Music Volume**: Volume slider (0-100%, default 70%)

**Single Timer Policy:**

- Only one timer can run at a time (prevents confusion)
- Timer must be stopped/completed before starting another

### Google Calendar Integration

Create Google Calendar events directly from action items with automatic linking and meeting tracking.

**Configuration Directory:**
daVIPA stores credentials in your home directory:

```
~/.getmoredone/credentials.json  # OAuth credentials (you provide)
~/.getmoredone/token.pickle      # Auth token (auto-generated)
```

This keeps credentials secure and shared across all projects — the Gmail
importer in `tools/` and the diagnostic scripts read the same directory, which
is why it is deliberately one fixed location rather than the app's own data
folder.

Create `~/.getmoredone` yourself and put `credentials.json` in it. Nothing in
daVIPA creates it *before* a successful sign-in — opening the calendar
dialog, or checking whether credentials exist, has no side effect, and the
"credentials not found" message names the exact path it checked. After that,
saving a token creates the directory if it is missing, and the Gmail importer
creates it whenever it runs.

**Setup (One-Time):**

1. See detailed setup instructions: `docs/google-calendar-setup.md`
2. Get OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
3. Place `credentials.json` in `~/.getmoredone/`
4. First use will prompt for authorization in browser

**Creating Calendar Events:**

1. Open an action item in Item Editor
2. Click **"📅 Calendar"** button (purple)
3. Fill in event details:
   - **Title**: Pre-filled from action item
   - **Date**: Use quick buttons or enter YYYY-MM-DD
   - **Time**: Set hour, minute, AM/PM (uses your local timezone automatically)
   - **Duration**: Minutes (default: 60)
   - **Description**: Optional (defaults to item description)
   - **Location**: Optional meeting location or URL
   - **Attendees**: Optional, comma-separated emails
4. Click **"Create Calendar Event"**
5. Event appears as a link in the item's Links tab
6. Action item automatically marked as meeting with scheduled time displayed

**Meeting Tracking:**

- ✅ **"Is Meeting"** checkbox automatically checked when calendar event created
- 🕒 **"Meeting Time"** field displays the scheduled date/time
- 📊 Track which action items are meetings vs regular tasks
- 🔍 Filter and report on meetings separately

**Benefits:**

- 📆 Schedule meetings without leaving daVIPA
- 🔗 Calendar link stored with action item for easy access
- ⏰ Pre-fills event with action item details
- 🌍 Uses your local timezone automatically (no more timezone confusion!)
- 📧 Optionally invite attendees
- 📍 Add location/meeting URL
- 📝 Automatically tracks meeting status and time

**Note:** Requires Google Calendar API credentials. See `docs/google-calendar-setup.md` for full setup instructions.

**Troubleshooting Authentication Issues:**

🧟 **ZOMBIE TOKEN PROBLEM** (Most Common Issue):
If Google login shows a **different project name** than expected (e.g., shows "bowen1rag" instead of "getmoredone"), you have a zombie token from an old project.

**Quick Fix:**

```bash
# Delete the old token
rm ~/.getmoredone/token.pickle

# Or use the fix script
./fix_zombie_token.sh

# Then re-authenticate
python3 tools/diagnose_google_auth.py
```

**Other Issues:** See `docs/EMAIL-AUTH-TROUBLESHOOTING.md` or run `./verify_auth.sh` to diagnose problems.

### Time Planning

1. Make sure the items' **Start Dates are right** — the Plan screen lists only
   items whose start date is exactly the date you select
2. Go to **Plan** screen and pick the date
3. Set the shape of the day once under **⚙ Day Settings** (day start, lunch,
   day end, which weekdays accept blocks)
4. Drag items from the left onto the half-hour box you want them in; **+ Break**
   and **+ Buffer** put padding in the first box that will hold it
5. Drag a task to another box to move it. Gaps are a legitimate day — nothing
   slides up to close one
6. Right-click a task to set its length (default 30 minutes, or the item's
   Work Block value if it has one). Lengths round up to whole boxes: 45 minutes
   takes two, keeps its own 45, and the second box reads `15m spare`

### Tracking Progress

- **TODAY**: See all items with start date <= today, separated into To Do and Completed sections with stats
- **Upcoming**: See what's due soon with Group/Category columns, complete items with checkbox
- **All Items**: Filter, sort, and bulk manage items
- **Hierarchical**: View parent-child relationships in tree structure with indentation
- **Completed**: Review completed items by date range with count and total time stats
- **Contacts**: Manage clients and contacts with searchable list
- **Stats**: Analyze planned vs actual time, accuracy by effort-cost

## Development

### Running Tests

Test-only packages live in `requirements-dev.txt`, which includes
`requirements.txt`, so one install covers both:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src/getmoredone

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_database.py -v

# Three tests build a real on-screen window and take keyboard focus.
# Skip them while you are working on the machine (CI never sets this):
GETMOREDONE_NO_MAPPED_WINDOWS=1 pytest
```

### Database

The project includes comprehensive test coverage with 21+ VSP-specific tests:

**Run all tests:**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**Run VSP tests only:**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_vps_integration.py -v
```

**Run standalone VSP test:**

```bash
python3 test_vps_segments.py
```

**Run editor dialog regression coverage:**

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_item_editor.py -v
```

- Includes regression checks for editor dialog centering and reveal order so blank-shell editor windows are caught earlier.

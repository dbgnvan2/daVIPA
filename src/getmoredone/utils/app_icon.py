"""Application icon setup (window / taskbar / macOS Dock).

Purpose: Show the daVIPA brand icon for the running app instead
         of the default Python launcher rocket in the macOS Dock (and the OS
         taskbar on Windows/Linux).
Spec:    docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-08-06-app-dock-icon.md
Tests:   tests/test_app_icon.py

Why the rocket appears: when a plain ``python`` process runs a Tk GUI, macOS
shows the interpreter's launcher rocket in the Dock. The Dock icon of a live
process is owned by NSApplication, not by Tk's ``iconphoto`` — so on macOS we
set it through AppKit (pyobjc). ``iconphoto`` still covers the Windows title bar
and taskbar and most Linux window managers.

"""Path utilities for GetMoreDone.

Goals:
- Keep *user-writable* files (SQLite DB, settings) out of the source tree.
- Work both when running from source and when packaged (PyInstaller).

User data location:
- macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/GetMoreDone/
- Windows: %APPDATA%\\GetMoreDone\\
- Linux: ~/.local/share/GetMoreDone/

We use `platformdirs` for correct platform behavior.

``GETMOREDONE_DATA_DIR`` overrides that whole directory, which is how a second
"demo" instance runs beside a real one without sharing its settings, its
single-instance lock or its logs. See docs/DEMO_INSTALL.md.

    ``GETMOREDONE_DATA_DIR`` overrides the location. It is deliberately a
    *directory* override rather than another per-file one: the database, the
    settings file, ``app.lock`` and ``weekly_tactic_debug.log`` all hang off
    this one call, and ``GETMOREDONE_DB`` isolates only the first of those. A
    demo instance sharing this directory with the installed app does not merely
    share a theme — ``acquire_single_instance_lock`` takes an exclusive
    ``flock`` on ``app.lock`` here, so the second launch exits with the
    "already running" dialog.

    Blank or whitespace-only is treated as unset, the same as
    ``GETMOREDONE_RESOURCE_ROOT`` above, so an exported-but-empty variable
    cannot silently redirect the app into the current directory.

    Always ``~/.getmoredone``. This is a *shared* location by design, not just
    the app's: ``gmail_importer`` reads it, ``tools/import_gmd_from_gmail.py``
    runs from a launchd timer against it, and six diagnostic scripts under
    ``tools/`` name it, as do README.md, INSTALL.md and
    docs/google-calendar-setup.md.

    An earlier version of this function preferred the app data directory on a
    machine that had never had ``~/.getmoredone``. That was wrong, and three
    independent reviews found it: the choice was re-evaluated on every call and
    keyed on a directory that other code creates as a side effect.
    ``gmail_importer._load_creds`` does an unconditional
    ``token_path.parent.mkdir()`` before it checks anything, and that runs from
    Settings > Integrations and from the launchd job — so a user who set the
    calendar up in the app data directory and then ran a Gmail import had the
    resolver flip underneath them, was told "credentials not found", and was
    sent through OAuth again with a working token orphaned in a directory
    nothing looked at any more.

    Resolving to one fixed location removes the flip, and keeps every existing
    install, tool and document correct. It does not create the directory:
    doing that before knowing a file is going there is the bug BI3 fixed.

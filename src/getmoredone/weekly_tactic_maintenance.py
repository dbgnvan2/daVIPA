"""Weekly Tactic data cleanup — dedupe and invariant repair.

Purpose: bring an existing database into line with WT-INV1/2/5, reporting

Both routines run automatically from the migration. That makes reporting the
whole safety story: a merge that destroys a child link, or a repair that
rewrites 53 dates, must never be indistinguishable from a no-op (P2). Every
function here returns what it did, and the migration logs it in full.

    Purpose: repair the WT-INV1 / WT-INV2 violations that pre-date this feature
             — 24 start dates and 29 due dates on the live database (WT-F10).
    Spec:    docs/spec_2026-08-18_weekly_tactic_scheduling.md#wt-m7b
    Tests:   tests/test_weekly_tactic_dedupe.py::test_wt_m7b1_existing_violations_repaired
             tests/test_weekly_tactic_dedupe.py::test_wt_m7b2_repair_reports_what_it_moved

    Runs automatically inside the migration, so three things carry the weight
    that a dry-run gate would otherwise have carried:

    * the full per-item before/after list is returned and logged, not a count —
      53 dates rewritten with nothing to show for it is the silent-drop shape
      of P2;
    * every move writes a ``reschedule_history`` row with
      ``reason='inv_repair'``, so a wrong one is reversible;
    * it is a no-op on an already-clean database, because it runs on every app
      start rather than once.

    ``normalization`` is the report from :func:`normalize_week_item_starts`.
    A week item that could not snap to its boundary leaves its children
    genuinely unrepairable — the week itself is in the wrong place — so those
    are reported here rather than silently counted as repaired.

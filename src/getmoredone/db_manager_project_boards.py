    # The two row mappers that used to live here — _row_to_project_board and
    # _row_to_project_board_link — were shadowed by identically named methods on
    # DatabaseManager and never ran. They had drifted: the copy here did not
    # hydrate start_date/end_date, so a reader following this file would have
    # concluded a project's dates are lost on load. They are not; the live copy
    # in db_manager.py reads them. Removed rather than fixed, because two
    # definitions of the same mapping is the defect.

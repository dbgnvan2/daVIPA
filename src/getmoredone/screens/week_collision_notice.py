"""The shared user-facing moments of a Weekly Tactic, on any screen.

Purpose: give the collision signal one wording and one place, so every surface
         that can move a week item reports it the same way; and the same for
         the question asked before completing a tactic that still has open
         children, which was written on one screen of seven.
Spec:    docs/spec_2026-08-18_weekly_tactic_scheduling.md#wt-m1c5
         docs/spec_2026-11-08_weekly_tactic_as_parent.md#wtp-m6
Tests:   tests/test_weekly_tactic_schema.py::test_wt_m1c5_collision_notice_reaches_the_user
         tests/test_weekly_tactic_completion_surfaces.py

``update_action_item`` and ``reschedule_item`` return False when a week item's
target week is already taken, and record the detail on
``db_manager.last_week_collision``. A return value nobody reads is the same
silence as no return value at all (P25) — so this is the reader.

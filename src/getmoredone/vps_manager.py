        APC-M4.1 — the month alone, not the month and its quarter. This
        replaced ``get_annual_plan_elements_for_period(year, quarter, month)``,
        whose callers both derived the quarter from the month and then required
        the matching quarter flag as well. That bought nothing when the flags
        agreed and hid the row when they did not: an APE with ``m11 = 1`` and
        ``q4 = 0`` was invisible in APE Week Assignment for every November week.

        APC-M4.4 — the guard is a membership test against the canonical map,
        and the column name is built from an ``int`` rather than from the
        argument as it arrived. ``month < 1 or month > 12`` was neither: it
        raises ``TypeError`` on a string and *passes* a float, and ``m_col`` is
        interpolated into the SQL as a column name — so ``11.0`` reached SQLite
        as ``m11.0`` and raised ``OperationalError`` from inside a Tk callback,
        where nothing is on screen to show it.

        Both halves are needed, and the membership test alone is the half that
        looks sufficient and is not: ``11.0 in {11: ...}`` is ``True``, because
        a dict is keyed by hash and equality, so a float passes the test. The

        The title match survives only as a one-time heal for a row whose id is

        never fires again for that row. It runs inside the caller's

        **The id is the whole predicate.** This lookup also filtered

        identifies one APE and an APE carries one year, so that clause could

        one without the others drifts them; when it drifted, this returned
        None, ``_get_or_create_annual_initiative_for_ape`` built a second
        initiative, and RN-F4's duplicate reappeared through the function

        "Exactly one **candidate**", not "exactly one initiative that matches"
        — the tier itself is a choice, and this path cannot report making it.
        Where two initiatives match and the plan year separates them, this
        heals to the preferred one silently. The migration's backfill sees the
        same pair and names both, which is where a human finds out.

        ``ai.year`` is the identifying comparison — the initiative's own year
        against the APE's. The annual plan's year is a **tie-break**, applied
        by ``find_initiative_candidates_by_title`` and shared with the
        migration's backfill so the two cannot drift.

        Requiring it outright hid an initiative whose plan year had drifted,
        and this heal finding nothing does not fail safe — the caller then
        creates the duplicate. Dropping it outright was worse: a twin on a
        drifted plan joined the candidate set, the count went from one to two,
        and the refusal above produced a **third** initiative for one plan

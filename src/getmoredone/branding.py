"""The application's name, in one place.

Purpose: make the displayed name a value rather than a literal repeated at
         every surface that shows it.
Spec:    docs/unused-docs/daVIPA_rebrand_prompt.md
Tests:   tests/test_branding.py

Three surfaces render the name to a person — the window title, the sidebar
wordmark and the ``--selftest`` banner — and each held its own copy of the
string. A rename then meant finding all three, which is how a display name
drifts from the one in the packaging.

**Deliberately NOT the same value as the paths.** ``paths.APP_NAME`` is the
identifier for the user-data directory and must not follow a rebrand: changing
it silently moves where the app looks for its database, and every existing
install would look like data loss rather than a rename. The two are separate
constants on purpose, and the test asserts they are allowed to differ.

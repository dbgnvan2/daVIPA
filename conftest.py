Two import styles coexist in this suite: `from src.getmoredone...` (needs the
repo root on sys.path) and `from getmoredone...` (needs src/). Several test
files used to insert src/ themselves — and two of them imported `getmoredone`
*before* their own insert ran, so they only worked when an alphabetically
earlier file had already done it. Running either alone was an error.

Putting both roots on the path once, here, removes that ordering dependency:

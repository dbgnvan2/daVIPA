## What Was Completed In This Session
1. Fixed icon-path resolution bug causing warnings like:
   - `Warning: Icon file not found: /Users/davemini2/ProjectsLocal/assets/icons/volume.png`
   - Root cause: `project_root()` path depth was off by one.
   - Fix: `/Users/davemini2/ProjectsLocal/GetMoreDone/src/getmoredone/paths.py`
2. Drag Schedule sizing behavior improved:
   - Re-loads settings on refresh.
   - `drag_schedule_box_height_px` now applies to BOTH columns:
     - left `Next Items` rows
     - right `Date Boxes` and future-option boxes
   - Right-side frames now lock to configured height (`grid_propagate(False)`).
   - Lower bound reduced for compact mode (from 50 to 20 px).
   - Vertical spacing reduced (more rows visible in same viewport).
   - File: `/Users/davemini2/ProjectsLocal/GetMoreDone/src/getmoredone/screens/drag_schedule.py`
3. User guide updated for Drag Schedule behavior:
   - File: `/Users/davemini2/ProjectsLocal/GetMoreDone/docs/USER_GUIDE.md`

## Known Test Status / Risks
### Last full maintained test run attempted
- Command: `pytest -q tests`
- Result: failing (`19 failed, 144 passed, 14 errors` in that run)

### Primary breakages observed
1. In-memory DB isolation regression in test setup:
   - `DatabaseManager(':memory:')` appears to resolve to a persistent path in current code path logic, causing data bleed across tests and `UNIQUE constraint failed: contacts.name` errors.
2. VPS API contract changed:
   - `create_quarter_initiative` now requires `annual_initiative_id`.
   - older tests still call it with `annual_plan_id` only.
3. Legacy test expectations no longer match current delete behavior and week-action behavior in some areas.

## Immediate Next Steps (Suggested Order)
1. Fix `:memory:` handling in DB path resolution so true SQLite in-memory mode is preserved.
2. Update integration tests to current hierarchy contract:
   - Annual Plan -> Annual Initiative -> Quarter Initiative
   - Ensure tests pass `annual_initiative_id` where required.
3. Re-run:
   - `pytest -q tests`
   - then coverage run with `--cov=src/getmoredone --cov-report=term-missing`
4. Update docs to reflect any behavior that changed during test-alignment.
5. Commit in logical chunks (db/test fixes, then docs).

## Useful Restart Prompt
Use this when returning to this project:

"Read `/Users/davemini2/ProjectsLocal/GetMoreDone/docs/unused-docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_2026-02-19.md`, review git status, continue with in-memory DB fix and test suite alignment to the AI->QI hierarchy, then run pytest and update docs accordingly."

# Implementation Plan — Downloadable GitHub Release (v0.1.0)

**Spec:** `docs/spec_2026-08-18_downloadable_release.md`
**Status:** built and on `main`. `build_mac.sh` and `daVIPA.spec` are the
packaging, `tests/test_release_docs.py` and `tests/test_release_licensing.py`
the checks. Corrected 2026-11-08 by the SST batch (`SSC-4`'s class).
**Date:** 2026-08-18

## 0. Baseline (measured, not assumed)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `pytest -q tests/` | 423 passed, 1 skipped — **exit 0** |
| `pytest -q <7 root test files>` | 20 passed — **exit 0** |
| `src/` total | 33,510 LOC / 74 files |
| Local `dist/GetMoreDone.app` contains `apple_grey.json` | **No** — confirms F1 |

The suite is green today. Any red after this work is caused by this work.

---

## 1. Acceptance criteria → test map

Every criterion is verified by a named automated test, a named workflow step, or
is flagged `HUMAN` with a review proposal. No criterion is left as an assertion.

### R-M2 — Licensing

| ID | Verified by | File |
|---|---|---|
| R-M2.A | `test_rm2a_license_file_exists_and_is_referenced` — `LICENSE` exists, non-empty, names the copyright holder and year, and `README.md` links it | `tests/test_release_docs.py` (new) |
| R-M2.A | **`HUMAN`** — license *wording* is a legal question, not a code question. Proposal: I draft it from a source-available template, you review it, and if the app is ever actually sold you have a lawyer review before the first paid sale. I am not a lawyer and this draft is not legal advice. | — |

| R-M3.C | `test_rm3c_no_workflow_greps_for_pass_token` — parse every workflow YAML; assert no step decides success by grepping for `passed`/`ok` (P24) | `tests/test_ci_contract.py` (new) |
| R-M3.D | `test_rm3d_all_test_files_are_collected` — assert every `test_*.py` in the repo is under a path pytest collects with the checked-in config | `tests/test_ci_contract.py` (new) |
| R-M3.E | `test_rm3e_workflows_contain_no_inline_assertions` — assert workflow steps only *invoke* the suite (global rule: never put a check only in the workflow) | `tests/test_ci_contract.py` (new) |

### R-M4 — Release pipeline

| ID | Verified by | File |
|---|---|---|
| R-M4.A | `test_rm4a_release_workflow_runs_selftest_on_built_bundle` — assert both OS jobs contain a selftest step that runs the **packaged executable**, not `python run.py` | `tests/test_ci_contract.py` (new) |
| R-M4.A | **`INTEGRATION-ONLY`** — that the packaged bundle genuinely starts can only be proven by the workflow executing on a real Windows/macOS runner. Reported as integration-verified, not unit-tested. Evidence: a green run of `build-release.yml`. | — |

| R-M5.D | `test_rm5d_install_doc_documents_gatekeeper_step` — assert `INSTALL.md` contains the quarantine command | `tests/test_release_docs.py` (new) |
| R-M5.D | **`HUMAN`** — that Gatekeeper actually behaves as documented needs one real download on a Mac that has never run GMD. Proposal: you download the first release artifact and confirm; I cannot verify Gatekeeper from this machine, which already trusts the local build. | — |

| R-M6.D | `test_rm6d_changelog_has_v0_1_0_entry` | `tests/test_release_docs.py` (new) |
| R-M6.* | **`HUMAN`** — whether the docs are *good* is not code-testable; the tests above only prove presence and absence of specific strings. Proposal: you read `INSTALL.md` once as a first-time user. | — |

### R-M7 — Hygiene

| ID | Verified by | File |
|---|---|---|
| R-M7.A | `test_rm7a_repo_root_has_no_stray_scripts` — assert no tracked root-level `test_*`/`diagnose_*`/`fix_*`/`debug_*` files | `tests/test_repo_hygiene.py` (new) |

## 2. Implementation order and dependencies

Ordered so the highest-risk, highest-impact fix is tested **first** (P10). Phase
1 is the fix for the bug that makes every existing release artifact dead on
arrival.

```
Phase 1 ──► Phase 2 ──► Phase 3 ──► Phase 4 ──► Phase 5 ──► Phase 6
(F1 fix)    (GPL)       (test CI)   (release)   (docs)      (hygiene)
```

### Phase 1 — Kill the crash (R-M1) · blocks everything

1. Write `tests/test_packaging_resources.py` **first**, including the frozen-mode
   test. Confirm it goes **red** against today's `GetMoreDone.spec` — a test for
   F1 that passes before the fix is not testing F1.
2. Add `themes` to `datas` in `GetMoreDone.spec`; add the `--onefile` prohibition
   comment (R-M1.D).
3. Harden `paths.resolve_theme_path` so the fallback is guaranteed to exist
   (R-M1.A.2).
4. Add `--selftest` to `run.py` + `tests/test_selftest_cli.py` (R-M1.B).
5. Fix the `build_mac.sh` / `build_windows.ps1` fallback (R-M1.C).
6. Rebuild locally, confirm `dist/` now contains `apple_grey.json`, and run the
   packaged binary's `--selftest`.

**Dependency:** none. **Risk:** low. **Est:** half a day.

### Phase 2 — Remove the GPL dependency (R-M2.B) · blocks the license

7. Write `tests/test_date_picker.py` against the **current** tkcalendar-backed
   picker; confirm green. This records the interface contract before the swap.
8. Write `tests/test_release_licensing.py`; confirm
   `test_rm2b3_no_gpl_dependency_anywhere` is **red**.
9. Build the stdlib-`calendar` CTk month grid inside `widgets/date_picker.py`,
   preserving the public interface. Follow the existing pattern at
   `screens/drag_schedule.py:1009`.
10. Re-run the Phase-2 tests — the same interface tests must still pass against
    the new implementation. Remove `tkcalendar` from `requirements.txt`.
11. Reinstall the venv from `requirements.txt` alone and re-run the **full**
    suite, to prove nothing else silently depended on it.

**Dependency:** none on Phase 1, but must land before R-M2.A ships.
**Risk: highest in this plan** — it replaces a working UI widget. This is the
phase most likely to need a second pass. **Est:** 1–1.5 days.

### Phase 3 — Test CI (R-M3) · gives every later phase a blank-machine check

12. Write `tests/test_ci_contract.py`.
13. Add `.github/workflows/tests.yml`: ubuntu, xvfb, install from
    `requirements.txt` only, decide by exit code.
14. Resolve R-M3.D — relocate the 7 root test files into `tests/` (this also
    starts R-M7.A).
15. Push and confirm green on a real runner. Fix whatever the blank machine
    exposes that this Mac hides.

**Dependency:** Phases 1–2, so CI starts green. **Est:** half a day.

### Phase 4 — Release pipeline (R-M4)

16. Extend `tests/test_ci_contract.py` with the R-M4 assertions.
17. Add the packaged-bundle selftest step to both jobs in `build-release.yml`
    (R-M4.A) — the automated guard against F1 recurring.
18. Add checksums, changelog-sourced release body, and LICENSE/NOTICES in the
    archives.
19. Dry-run via `workflow_dispatch` with no tag; download both artifacts.

**Dependency:** Phase 1 (selftest must exist), Phase 3. **Est:** half a day.

### Phase 5 — Licensing text, first run, docs (R-M2.A/C/D, R-M5, R-M6)

20. Draft `LICENSE` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. **Pause for your review.**
21. Write `tests/test_first_run.py` and `tests/test_release_docs.py`.
22. Fix any first-run degradation gaps the tests expose (R-M5.A).
23. Write `INSTALL.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`; update `README.md` and
    `docs/STANDALONE_BUILD.md`.

**Dependency:** Phase 2 (notices must reflect the post-tkcalendar tree).
**Est:** 1 day.

### Phase 6 — Hygiene, then tag (R-M7)

24. Write `tests/test_repo_hygiene.py`; relocate remaining root clutter.
25. Run `learning-qa` over the whole diff (global process step 5); fix findings.
26. Write the handoff note at `docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-08-18-downloadable-release.md`.
27. Generate `docs/spec_coverage.md` and the completion status report.
28. Tag `v0.1.0` → release workflow → **you download and confirm R-M5.D.**

**Est:** half a day.

**Total: roughly 4 days of focused work.** Phase 2 carries the schedule risk.

## 3. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **The date-picker rewrite regresses date entry** — highest risk in the plan. It touches a widget used across many screens. | Interface tests written against the old widget *first* (step 7), so the new one must satisfy a contract recorded before the swap. Plus a real-app check per the `verify-gui-in-running-app` memory: launch under the venv, exercise the picker, check `app.log`. |
| Tk tests behave differently under xvfb than on macOS | Phase 3 runs before the release pipeline depends on CI. If a test is genuinely display-dependent, it gets marked and reported as such rather than silently skipped (R-M3.B exists to prevent a silent skip). |
| The proprietary license draft is legally weak | Flagged `HUMAN`. It is a template, not legal advice. Real legal review belongs before the first paid sale, not before a free release. |
| A future dependency reintroduces a GPL license | `test_rm2b3_installed_runtime_deps_have_no_gpl_license` checks the whole tree, not just tkcalendar. |
| Windows build unverifiable from this Mac | Explicitly `INTEGRATION-ONLY`. Proven by a green CI run, reported as such — never claimed as locally tested. |

---

## 4. What this plan does not do

- No Railway/Vercel/web work. Out of scope per spec §2.
- No macOS signing or notarization (D2).
- No Linux binary.
- The three adjacent issues in spec §6 are flagged, not fixed (global rule 10).

---

## 5. Approval gate

Per the global planning rules, implementation stops here. Nothing in `src/`,
`tests/`, `.github/`, or the build files has been modified. On approval, work
starts at Phase 1 step 1, and I will pause again at Phase 5 step 20 for your
review of the license text.

## Summary
Updated Annual Vision Segments screen so both left Vision Elements and right Annual Vision Elements use color-chip treatment for all three columns (Segment, SubSegment, Category). Updated section titles per request:
- Left: `Vision Elements (check elements to add to the year and hit save)`
- Right: `Annual Vision Elements for the year <YEAR>`

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/annual_vision_segments.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-02-28-annual-vision-category-chip-and-title-updates.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- Category color for annual rows is resolved via current Vision Categories mapping by `(segment, subsegment, category)` key; if names diverge from source mapping, fallback uses subsegment color.

## Next agent actions
- If needed, add explicit per-row tooltips for full (unclipped) category names.

- Topic: Vision Elements and Annual Vision Segments 3-column layout + checkbox Save flow

## Summary
Updated Vision Elements and Annual Vision Segments to use a consistent 3-column Segment/SubSegment/Category presentation with color-coded chips and without displaying the duplicate key-field string.

Annual Vision Segments now supports checkbox-based selection on the left list and a Save action to create annual records in the right list. SubSegment and Category display values are clipped to 20 characters for tighter columns.

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- Existing drag/drop wording and legacy helper methods remain in the annual screen source, but creation now follows checkbox + Save behavior.

## Next agent actions

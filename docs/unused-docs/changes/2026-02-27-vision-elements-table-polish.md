- Agent: Code
- Topic: Vision Elements table alignment polish

## Summary
Applied a minimal UI polish pass to the Vision Elements table so columns align more consistently: the Category cell width now matches the padded layout used by other columns, and the Actions header/cell content is right-aligned for cleaner edge alignment.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/vision_elements.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-02-27-vision-elements-table-polish.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- UI alignment updates are not currently covered by automated visual tests.

## Next agent actions
- Docs Agent: no required follow-up unless you want to record this UI polish in release notes/changelog.

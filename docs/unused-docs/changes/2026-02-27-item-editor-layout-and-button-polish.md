# Handoff Note

- Date: 2026-02-27
- Agent: Code
- Topic: Item editor layout and action button polish

## Summary
Updated the item editor UI to improve resizing and visual clarity:
- moved the divider to sit between Description and Next Action so drag-resize grows top editor area and shrinks lower editor area.
- adjusted Priority tab score area so the score is right-aligned and easier to read (removed dark hard-coded score container color).
- reduced Notes tab records area height.
- normalized bottom action button widths, tightened horizontal padding, changed button labels (`Add Tasks`, `Add Follow-up`, `Set Wk Tactic`), and made `Complete` use danger styling (red background).

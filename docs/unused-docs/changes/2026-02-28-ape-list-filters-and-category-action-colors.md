## Summary
Implemented Segment/SubSegment/Category filtering on the three APE list views and updated action-item color resolution to prefer Category color.

Changes made:
- Added cascading Segment/SubSegment/Category filter controls on:
  - APE Assignment
  - APE Period View
  - APE Weekly
- Filters are combinable and update list contents immediately.
- Updated shared action-item color resolver to use Category color first (via APE lineage), then fallback to SubSegment color, then Segment color.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/ape_assignment.py
- src/getmoredone/screens/ape_period_view.py
- src/getmoredone/screens/weekly_items.py
- src/getmoredone/screens/segment_color_utils.py
- tests/test_weekly_item_filters.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-02-28-ape-list-filters-and-category-action-colors.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- Weekly filter option generation uses parsed lineage from row/title fallback for legacy records without full APE fields.
- Category color lookup for action items is name-based; if names drift from source records, fallback path applies.

## Next agent actions
- If desired, persist filter selections in app settings per screen.

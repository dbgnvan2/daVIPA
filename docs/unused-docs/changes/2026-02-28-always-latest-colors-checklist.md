# Handoff Note

- Date: 2026-02-28
- Agent: Code
- Topic: always-latest-colors-checklist

## Summary
Implemented a shared "always latest colors" path for VPS lineage chips so Segment/SubSegment colors are always resolved from current Vision Segment/SubSegment records at render time (instead of per-screen ad hoc map logic).

Implementation checklist used in this pass:
- [x] Baseline verify current workspace and run tests before changes.
- [x] Add one shared helper to load current Segment/SubSegment color maps.
- [x] Add one shared resolver for Segment + SubSegment chip colors with fallback.
- [x] Wire all VPS 3-column lineage list screens to shared resolver.
- [x] Preserve existing theme tokens and only keep data-driven lineage colors for chips.
- [x] Re-run test suite and confirm no regressions.

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- Color updates still require screen refresh/reload to repaint currently-visible rows.
- Existing legacy screens outside this lineage set may still use local color lookups.

## Next agent actions
- Extend this shared resolver to any remaining non-VPS list screens if lineage chips are added there.

## Summary
Added Category color chip treatment to the Category column on:
- APE Assignment
- APE Period View
- APE Weekly

Each screen now resolves category color from current Vision Categories by `(segment, subsegment, category)` and falls back to subsegment color when no exact mapping is found.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/ape_assignment.py
- src/getmoredone/screens/ape_period_view.py
- src/getmoredone/screens/weekly_items.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-02-28-category-colors-ape-assignment-period-weekly.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- If an APE/weekly row name no longer matches a current Vision Category name, category chip falls back to subsegment color.

## Next agent actions
- If needed, add explicit category color fields to APE/weekly query payloads to avoid name-based fallback resolution.

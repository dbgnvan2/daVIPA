# Handoff Note

- Agent: Code
- Topic: ape-assignment-right-column-tightening-and-control-alignment

## Summary
Refined APE Quarter/Month Assignment layout to remove extra whitespace in the right Quarters/Months region and align Year/Load/Segment/SubSegment/Category controls in one row under the title.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/ape_assignment.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-03-01-ape-assignment-right-column-tightening-and-control-alignment.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- Right panel is intentionally constrained and may clip sooner on very narrow windows (by design to preserve left APE list readability).

## Next agent actions
- If you want even tighter spacing, reduce right `minsize` values and list widths further.

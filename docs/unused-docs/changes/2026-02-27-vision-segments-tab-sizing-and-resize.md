# Handoff Note

- Date: 2026-02-27
- Agent: Code
- Topic: Vision Segments tab button sizing and responsive records pane

## Summary
Adjusted Vision Segments layout behavior so the screen content expands with the window and the records container stays linked to the bottom edge. Also increased the Segments/SubSegments/Categories tab-button height to match regular button sizing more closely.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/vision_segments.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-02-27-vision-segments-tab-sizing-and-resize.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- Tab button height customization uses CustomTkinter tabview internals; if CTk internals change in a future upgrade, this may need adjustment.

## Next agent actions
- Docs Agent: optional changelog note for Vision Segments responsiveness and tab sizing polish.

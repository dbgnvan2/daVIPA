## Summary
Fixed Vision Segments center tab control so only vertical height is forced to match regular buttons (no tab width override). Reduced horizontal widths of other regular buttons in the same area.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/vision_segments.py
- src/getmoredone/screens/vision_planning_hub.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-02-28-vps-tab-height-fix-and-button-width-reduction.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- Center tab height uses CTkTabview private layout hooks and should be re-validated after CustomTkinter upgrades.

## Next agent actions
- If you want tighter or looser sizing, tune constants: `NAV_BUTTON_WIDTH` and `ACTION_BUTTON_WIDTH`.

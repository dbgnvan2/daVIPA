- Topic: ape-responsive-followup-and-right-shrink-priority

## Summary
Applied the same responsive compaction process to APE Period View and APE Weekly, and further tuned APE Assignment so the Quarters/Months side shrinks first.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/ape_assignment.py
- src/getmoredone/screens/ape_period_view.py
- src/getmoredone/screens/weekly_items.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-03-01-ape-responsive-followup-and-right-shrink-priority.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- Very narrow widths still clip long chip text by design (fixed-width dense columns).

## Next agent actions
- If desired, add dynamic compact chip limits (shorter clip lengths below width threshold).

## Summary
Applied responsive compaction pattern across APE screens and prioritized shrinking Quarters/Months first on APE Assignment.

Changes:
- APE Assignment:
  - Right Quarters/Months panel now shrinks first (left/right weight and minsize rebalanced).
  - Quarters/Months columns narrowed further (`width=140`, tighter min sizes and spacing).
- APE Period View:
  - Header converted to compact two-row grid layout.
  - Narrower Year/Quarter/Month and filter controls.
  - Body columns rebalanced for smaller windows.
- APE Weekly:
  - Header made more responsive with filters on second row.
  - Narrowed Week/Load/This Week/filter control widths.
  - Body columns rebalanced for compact widths.

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- Extremely narrow widths may still truncate text/chips because list rows remain fixed-column chip layouts by design.

## Next agent actions
- If required, add optional compact mode to reduce chip text clipping limits when window width is below threshold.

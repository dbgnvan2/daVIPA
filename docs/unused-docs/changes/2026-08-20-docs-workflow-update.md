# Handoff Note

- Date: 2026-08-20
- Agent: Code
- Topic: Retire the multi-agent workflow docs; add review-sweep and test rules; extend the global learnings catalogue

## Summary

Docs-only. No `src/` or `tests/` changes.

Acts on the 2026-08-20 external audit. Three things:

1. **The three-agent branch workflow is retired** in `CLAUDE.md` and
   `AGENTS.md`. It described branches that do not exist.
2. **New `Review sweeps` and `Test rules` sections** in `CLAUDE.md`, encoding
   the sweep budget and the test-quality rules the audit asked for.
3. **`~/.claude/standards/learnings.md` gains P27–P29** plus corollaries on
   P19 and P26, and five new review-checklist items so the patterns are
   actually consulted rather than merely recorded.

## Claims verified before writing

The audit's cited commits were checked with `git log -1 --format=%b` rather
than taken on trust. All three exist and their messages support the claims:

| Commit | Claim | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `3892159` | 16 vacuous tests; one opened the production DB | **Confirmed.** Message: "It was sixteen across four files, and two of them were doing real harm." `test_enhanced_deletion_protection` was `return False` over a guard dead since `delete_segment`'s return shape changed; `test_database` called `DatabaseManager()` with no path, and `__init__` runs migrations, a row-deleting dedupe and a date-moving repair |
| `2383cbd` | Pass 10's fix caused a high-severity regression caught at pass 11 | **Confirmed.** Pass 10 changed `count` to exclude the target board and left the sentence deriving from the old meaning, understating a deletion by exactly one link |
| `eac201f` | A `> 20` floor hid a 154 → 127 narrowing | **Confirmed**, with the direction worth stating precisely: the scan had narrowed *to* 127 and the fix restored it *to* 154. The floor was satisfied throughout |

Two corrections to the prompt's assumptions:

- **`learnings.md` is at P26, not "at least through P8".** New entries are
  P27–P29.
- **Three of the five proposed entries duplicated existing patterns**, so per
  the prompt's own instruction they extend rather than add numbers:
  *fix passes create defects* → a new corollary on **P26**;
  *source-grep assertions go stale* → a new corollary on **P19**;
  *floor assertions* was distinct enough from P9 to earn **P29** of its own.

## Files changed

- `CLAUDE.md` — `Multi-agent workflow` → `Working agreements`; new
  `Review sweeps` and `Test rules` sections; Commands block documents
  `pytest -m "not meta"`, `pytest -m meta` and
  `GETMOREDONE_NO_MAPPED_WINDOWS=1 pytest`.
- `AGENTS.md` — the workflow half replaced. **Not** reduced to a pointer: the
  second half is the live UI Theme System spec, which `CLAUDE.md` references,
  and it is preserved verbatim. The handoff-note requirement, docs-sync rule,
  merge gates and UI-regression guardrail are retained — none of them was ever
  about the agent split.
- `~/.claude/standards/learnings.md` (separate repo `dbgnvan2/claude-standards`,
  pulled before editing, committed `1263158`, pushed) — P27, P28, P29;
  corollaries on P19 and P26; checklist items 28–32.

## Verification

- `git diff --name-only` in this repo: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` only. No
  `src/`, no `tests/`.
- The standards repo was pulled before editing and pushed after, per the
  two-Mac sync rule in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
- Suite untouched and still green from the Batch 3 push: 1108 passed,
  5 skipped, exit 0.

## Risks / Known gaps

- **The sweep cap was revised after review — RESOLVED 2026-08-20.** The rule
  originally landed as "maximum 2 sweep passes per batch", per the audit. I
  implemented it as specified and recorded a disagreement: the batch finishing
  immediately before it had rounds 3 and 4 each find a defect, one of them
  user-facing (a status `print` inside a credential `try` that discarded a
  valid token). A flat two-pass cap ships that.

  The user resolved it by adjusting the count and making the distinction
  structural rather than a trailing caveat. `CLAUDE.md`'s **Review sweeps** now
  reads:

  - at most **2 warm** passes;
  - at least **1 cold** pass, always — the requirement, not the optional extra;
  - a further pass only after a high-severity finding, and make it cold too.

  Both datasets are cited under it, because they genuinely point different
  ways: twelve warm passes yielded only meta-findings by the end, while two
  cold passes found user-facing defects. The variable that separates them is
  the pass *kind*, not the count, and the rule now says so in its structure
  instead of in a footnote.

- **The retirement is not complete.** Four files still describe the dead
  workflow and were left alone, because rewriting them is not this task:
  `docs/MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`, `.agents/prompts/{code,docs,github}-agent.md`,
  and `tools/agents/setup_worktrees.sh` (which creates the three branches).
  `tools/agents/check_docs_sync.py` is live and correct and stays.
  Recorded in `BACKLOG.md`.

- **`pytest -m "not meta"` was documented before it existed** — marked PENDING
  at the time, because documenting an invocation that does not work is a small
  P21 risk. It landed later the same day with the test-suite remediation batch
  (198 tests marked, 27.4s vs 55.9s), and the PENDING marker is gone.

## Next agent actions

- The test-suite remediation batch (`docs/prompt-test-suite-remediation.md`): the
  `meta` marker, source-grep elimination, the live-data conftest guard, and the
  vacuous-test scan. Ten tests from Batch 3 are already recorded in
  `BACKLOG.md` as unable to fail; they belong in that batch's task 4.

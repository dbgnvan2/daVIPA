# Handoff Note

- Date: 2026-03-01
- Agent: Code
- Topic: remove-vision-elements-from-vps-hub

## Summary
Removed the `Vision Elements` button and route from the Vision Planning hub screen so it is no longer accessible there.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/vision_planning_hub.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-03-01-remove-vision-elements-from-vps-hub.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- This only removes hub access; direct class/module still exists in codebase.

## Next agent actions
- If full removal is desired, remove unused imports/references and any tests tied to direct `VisionElementsScreen` navigation.

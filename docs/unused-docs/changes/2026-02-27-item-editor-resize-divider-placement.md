# Handoff Note

- Date: 2026-02-27
- Agent: Code
- Topic: Item editor divider moved below Planned Minutes

## Summary
Adjusted item editor layout so the draggable black divider is now below the Planned Minutes field, between the top input section and the lower Next Action section. Dragging the divider now resizes the upper and lower text areas accordingly.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/item_editor.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-02-27-item-editor-resize-divider-placement.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- Divider currently controls text-area heights in the left pane; it does not resize the right tab panel independently.

## Next agent actions
- Docs Agent: optional release note update describing adjusted divider placement/behavior.

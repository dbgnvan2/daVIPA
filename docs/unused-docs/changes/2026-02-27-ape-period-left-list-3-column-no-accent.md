- Topic: APE Period View left list converted to 3-column chips without accent bar

## Summary
Updated APEs In Period (left side) to match the same treatment used on other APE/annual lists:
- removed vertical accent bars.
- replaced key-field text rows with 3 columns: Segment, SubSegment, Category.
- preserved row select behavior and Edit/Delete actions.
- applied subsegment color mapping and compact clipped labels for tighter columns.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/ape_period_view.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-02-27-ape-period-left-list-3-column-no-accent.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- Long labels are clipped more aggressively due to compact column widths.

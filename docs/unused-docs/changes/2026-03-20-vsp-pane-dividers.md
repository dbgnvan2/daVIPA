## Summary
Added draggable center dividers to the missing split-view Vision Planning tabs so users can resize the left and right panels consistently across the APE workflow. `Annual Plan Elements` already had this behavior and `APE Weekly` already used a split pane; this change brings `APE Assignment` and `APE Period View` in line with them.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/ape_assignment.py
- src/getmoredone/screens/ape_period_view.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-03-20-vsp-pane-dividers.md

## Verification
- Command: `python3 -m py_compile src/getmoredone/screens/ape_assignment.py src/getmoredone/screens/ape_period_view.py`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- `Vision Elements` remains a single-list admin screen, so there is no left/right split there to resize.
- This change was compile-verified but not exercised by an automated GUI interaction test.

## Next agent actions
- If desired, add UI-level regression coverage for splitter presence/initial ratio across the Vision Planning split screens.
- If `Vision Elements` is later redesigned into a true two-panel layout, reuse the same divider pattern there.

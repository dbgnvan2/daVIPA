## Summary
Updated the left-side Annual Plan Elements list in APE Quarter/Month Assignment to match the new visual treatment:
- removed the vertical accent bar.
- replaced key-field text with 3 columns: Segment, SubSegment, Category.
- applied segment/subsegment color chips with truncated labels for compact columns.

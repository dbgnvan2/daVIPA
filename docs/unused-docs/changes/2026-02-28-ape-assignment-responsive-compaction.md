## Summary
Adjusted APE Assignment screen layout to behave better when resizing from large to smaller window widths.

Changes:
- Converted header controls to a two-row grid so controls can fit smaller widths without severe horizontal overflow.
- Narrowed input/selector widths (`Year`, `Load`, Segment/SubSegment/Category filter combos).
- Rebalanced main body columns to favor list readability on smaller windows.
- Tightened Quarters/Months panel paddings and checkbox spacing so those columns are narrower and denser.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/ape_assignment.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-02-28-ape-assignment-responsive-compaction.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- This pass focused on APE Assignment since that is the screen shown. Similar responsive compaction can be applied to APE Period View and APE Weekly headers if desired.

## Next agent actions
- Mirror this compaction pattern to APE Period View and APE Weekly for full consistency.

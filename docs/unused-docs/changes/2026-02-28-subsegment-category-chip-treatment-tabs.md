- Agent: Code
- Topic: subsegment-category-chip-treatment-tabs

## Summary
Applied the same chip color treatment to SubSegment and Category fields on the `SubSegments` and `Categories` tabs in Vision Segments.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/vision_segments.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-02-28-subsegment-category-chip-treatment-tabs.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- This screen now uses three chip columns in Categories (`Segment`, `SubSegment`, `Category`), so long descriptions may truncate sooner depending on window width.

## Next agent actions
- If you want explicit headers for these columns, add a header row to each tab list.

# Handoff Note

- Date: 2026-02-27
- Agent: Code
- Topic: Annual Vision list bars removed, columns tightened, subsegment colors aligned

## Summary
Adjusted Annual Vision Segments list rendering to match requested polish:
- removed left-edge vertical accent bars from list rows.
- reduced Segment/SubSegment/Category display widths (roughly 5-character tighter each) and clipping limits.
- fixed subsegment chip colors on the Annual Vision Elements (right list) so they match the source list by resolving color from segment+subsegment mapping.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/annual_vision_segments.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-02-27-annual-vision-columns-and-subsegment-colors.md

## Verification

# Handoff Note

- Topic: annual-vision-resizable-divider-and-tight-actions

## Summary
Added a draggable vertical divider between Vision Elements and Annual Vision Elements panels on the Annual Vision Segments screen, so users can resize panel widths by dragging the dark center line. Also tightened right-list action alignment by removing the extra spacer column so `Edit/Delete` sit closer to `Category`.

## Files changed
- src/getmoredone/screens/annual_vision_segments.py
- docs/unused-docs/changes/2026-02-28-annual-vision-resizable-divider-and-tight-actions.md

## Verification
- Command: `pytest -q`
- Result: PASS

## Risks / Known gaps
- Divider drag behavior is constrained by a minimum panel width (`MIN_PANEL_WIDTH=420`) to avoid collapsing either panel too far.

## Next agent actions
- If needed, tune splitter limits (`MIN_PANEL_WIDTH`) based on preferred minimum width.

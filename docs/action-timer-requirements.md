# Action Timer Module - Functional Requirements

Note: This document has been consolidated into `GetMoreDone_MasterSpec_SQLite_v1.md` and is kept for historical reference. Please update the master spec going forward.

## Overview

The Action Timer Module provides a popup countdown timer to guide users through completing action items with time blocking, break management, and completion workflows.

---

## FR-AT-001: Popup Timer Display

**User Story**: As a user I want to see a pop up count down timer screen to guide me to complete work.

**Description**: Display a popup timer window showing countdown and action details.

**Requirements**:

- Display action item title prominently
- Show three time values:
  - **Time Block**: Total allocated time (e.g., 30 minutes)
  - **Time To Finish**: Work time remaining before break (e.g., 25 minutes)
  - **Wrap/Break**: Break duration (e.g., 5 minutes)
- Display countdown timer with minutes and seconds
- Show Start/Pause/Stop control buttons
- Timer updates every second

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Timer window appears on demand when user starts a time block
- All three time values are clearly labeled and visible
- Countdown shows MM:SS format
- Window stays on top of other windows

---

## FR-AT-002: Next Steps Display

**User Story**: I want to be reminded of the next steps so I can get started easier.

**Description**: Display next steps/notes from the action item to help user get started.

**Requirements**:

- Show "Next Steps:" section in timer window
- Display the action item's description or notes field
- Text should be readable but not dominate the timer display
- Support multi-line text display

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Next steps text is visible in timer window
- Text wraps appropriately within window bounds
- Empty next steps shows placeholder text or empty section

---

## FR-AT-003: Pause and Resume Timer

**User Story**: As a user I want to pause my timer and then restart the timer and keep track of the time worked versus the total elapsed time from start to stop.

**Description**: Allow pausing and resuming timer while tracking both work time and total elapsed time.

**Requirements**:

- **Start** button initiates countdown
- **Pause** button:
  - Stops countdown
  - Changes to "Resume" button
  - Maintains current time remaining
- **Resume** button restarts countdown from paused time
- Track two separate time values:
  - **Work Time**: Sum of all active (non-paused) time periods
  - **Elapsed Time**: Total time from first Start to final Stop
- **Stop** button ends the time block completely

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Pause/Resume can be used multiple times in one session
- Work time only increments when timer is actively running
- Elapsed time continues even when paused
- Both times are saved to WorkLog when stopped

---

## FR-AT-004: Complete Time Block and Action

**User Story**: As a user I want to complete the time block, add a Session Note to the Action, and complete the Action.

**Description**: Provide "Finished" workflow to complete both time block and action item.

**Requirements**:

- **Finished** button available when timer is stopped
- Clicking Finished:
  1. Shows the "Session Notes" dialog
  2. Saves work log entry with work time and elapsed time
  3. Appends the note to the action item's description, dated MM-DD, and
     stores it on the work log — the same as every other ending
  4. Marks action item as completed with completion timestamp
  5. Closes timer window
- Completion note is optional but dialog must be shown
- User can cancel to return to timer without completing

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Finished workflow saves WorkLog entry
- Action item status changes to "completed"
- Completion note is appended to action item notes/description
- Timer window closes after successful completion
- All data persisted to database

---

## FR-AT-005: Continue Action to Next Day

**User Story**: As a user I want to be able to Continue an Action Item by completing the Next Action I'm working and Create a new Next Action that is a duplicate of the current one, but for the next day.

**Description**: Provide "Continue" workflow for ongoing actions that span multiple days.

**Requirements**:

- **Complete & Create Follow Up** button available when timer is stopped
- Clicking it:
  1. Shows the "Session Notes" dialog for current work; what is typed is
     appended to the ORIGINAL action item's description, dated MM-DD, and also
     stored on the work log
  2. Saves work log entry for time block — this is the "Complete" in the
     button's name. The current action item is **not** completed; only "Done"
     completes an action item
  3. Creates duplicate action item with:
     - Title = "<original title> - Follow up MM-DD", the day the follow-up was
       made. An existing stamp is replaced rather than appended to, so a
       follow-up of a follow-up carries one date, not a chain of them
     - Same who, priority factors, category, group
     - Start date = the original item's start date, unchanged
     - Due date = the original item's due date, unchanged
     - Notes/description = "Add your next steps and set the dates and priority"
     - Status = "open"
     - New unique ID
     - The project link, weekly-tactic lineage and item links of the original,
       through the same helper create_followup_item uses
  4. Opens the follow-up in the item editor, where those fields are filled in
- The Session Notes dialog is optional but must be presented

Revised 2026-08-25. The "Next Steps Note" dialog was removed from this flow: it
asked for a note and two dates before the follow-up existed, duplicating the
editor that opens immediately afterwards, and it was the modal that opened
behind the always-on-top timer and took every click. The +1 day shift went with
it — a follow-up continues the same work and keeps the same dates. The step
that completed the current action item went too: the button completes the timer
record, not the task. See
docs/unused-docs/implementation_plan_2026-08-25_timer_session_endings.md.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Current action marked completed with work log
- New action created for next day
- New action opens in editor for review
- All relevant fields copied to new action
- Dates properly incremented
- Next steps note populates new action's description

---

## FR-AT-006: Default Break Time

**User Story**: As user I want default break time e.g. 5 minutes at the end of the Time Block (subtracted from the Time Block). A 30 minute time block is 25 minutes + 5 minute Break time.

**Description**: Automatically allocate break time at end of work time.

**Requirements**:

- Default break time = 5 minutes (configurable in settings)
- Break time is **subtracted** from total time block
- Calculation: Work Time = Time Block - Break Time
- Example: 30 minute block = 25 min work + 5 min break
- Timer counts down work time first, then break time
- Display shows three values:
  - Time Block: Total allocated (30)
  - Time To Finish: Work time countdown (25)
  - Wrap/Break: Break duration (5)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Break time automatically calculated from time block
- Work timer counts down before break starts
- Break timer starts automatically when work time reaches zero
- User can skip break and finish immediately
- Break time setting available in application settings

---

## FR-AT-007: Resizable Floating Window

**User Story**: As a user I want to have the Action Timer as a resizable floating window with the Time remaining in the title bar.

**Description**: Timer appears as floating, always-on-top, resizable window.

**Requirements**:

- Timer window is a separate floating window
- Window properties:
  - Always on top of other application windows
  - Resizable by dragging edges/corners
  - Minimum size: 300x200 pixels
  - Maximum size: unlimited
  - Remembers size preference for future sessions
- Title bar shows: "[Action Title] - [MM:SS remaining]"
- Title bar updates every second with countdown
- Window can be moved anywhere on screen

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Timer window stays on top during use
- User can resize window and size persists
- Time remaining visible in window title bar
- Window position and size saved between sessions
- Can be minimized but remains accessible

---

## FR-AT-008: Green Title Bar Warning

**User Story**: As a user I want the title bar to be green when Time remaining is < 10 minutes.

**Description**: Change title bar color to green as visual warning when approaching deadline.

**Requirements**:

- Default title bar color: System default or application theme
- When time remaining < 10 minutes (during work time):
  - Title bar background changes to **green**
  - Text remains readable (white or black based on contrast)
- Color change applies to window title bar decoration
- Green color persists until timer stops or time expires

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Title bar turns green at 9:59 remaining
- Color change is immediately visible
- Text remains readable on green background
- Returns to normal color if timer is reset/restarted above 10 min
- Only applies during work time, not break time

---

## FR-AT-009: Independent Music Controls

**User Story**: As a user I want separate controls to play and pause music that are independent from the timer Start/Pause/Stop buttons.

**Description**: Provide separate music playback controls that operate independently from timer controls.

**Requirements**:

- Separate music control section with:
  - **Play button** (🎵 ▶ Play) - Starts or resumes music
  - **Pause button** (⏸ Pause) - Pauses/resumes music
- Music controls are **independent** from timer controls:
  - Pausing the timer does NOT pause the music
  - Resuming the timer does NOT affect music state
  - Stopping the timer stops the music
- Button states:
  - Play button disabled when music is playing
  - Pause button enabled when music is playing
  - Pause button changes to "▶ Resume" when music is paused
- Visual distinction: Purple color theme for music buttons
- Position: Between timer controls and status label

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Music Play button starts music from configured folder
- Music Pause button pauses/resumes music independently
- Timer pause does not affect music playback
- Button states update correctly based on music status
- Music continues playing when timer is paused
- Music stops when timer is stopped

---

## FR-AT-009: Break Time Title Bar

**User Story**: As a user I want the title Bar to show "BREAK" and time remaining in time block when time remaining is <= Break Time.

**Description**: Display "BREAK" indicator in title bar during break period.

**Requirements**:

- When work time reaches 00:00, break time begins
- Title bar changes to show:
  - Format: "[Action Title] - BREAK [MM:SS remaining]"
  - Example: "Write Report - BREAK 04:32"
- Break time counts down from break duration (e.g., 5:00)
- Title bar color during break: Different from work time (suggest yellow/amber)
- "BREAK" text prominently displayed in title

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Title changes to BREAK format when work time expires
- Break countdown starts at break duration
- BREAK indicator clearly visible in title bar
- Title bar color distinguishes break from work time
- User can skip break and click Finished/Continue during break

---

## FR-AT-010: Time Block Initialization

**Supporting Requirement**: How timer is started from action items.

**Description**: Launch timer from action item with pre-populated data.

**Requirements**:

- Add "Start Timer" button to action item screens:
  - Today screen
  - Upcoming screen
  - All Items screen
  - Item editor
- Button only visible for open (non-completed) items
- Clicking "Start Timer":
  1. Reads action item's `planned_minutes` field
  2. Calculates work time and break time
  3. Opens timer window with action data
  4. Auto-starts countdown (or requires Start click)
- If `planned_minutes` is null/empty, prompt for time block duration

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Timer can be launched from any action item view
- Planned minutes used as default time block
- User prompted if no planned time set
- Timer window opens with correct action details
- Can only run one timer at a time

---

## FR-AT-011: Work Log Persistence

**Supporting Requirement**: How timer data is saved.

**Description**: Save all timer activity to WorkLog table.

**Requirements**:

- Create WorkLog entry when timer stops containing:
  - `item_id`: Action item ID
  - `started_at`: Timestamp when Start first clicked (ISO format)
  - `ended_at`: Timestamp when Stop clicked (ISO format)
  - `minutes`: Work time (minutes actively worked, excluding pauses)
  - `note`: Completion note or next steps note
  - `created_at`: Record creation timestamp
- WorkLog uses existing database schema (see models.py)
- Multiple work logs can exist per action item
- Work logs viewable in action item history

**Acceptance Criteria**:

## Settings Configuration

New settings needed in AppSettings:

```python
@dataclass
class AppSettings:
    # ... existing settings ...

    # Timer settings
    default_time_block_minutes: int = 30
    default_break_minutes: int = 5
    timer_window_width: int = 450
    timer_window_height: int = 550
    timer_window_x: Optional[int] = None
    timer_window_y: Optional[int] = None
    timer_warning_minutes: int = 10  # When to show green warning

    # Audio settings (NEW)
    enable_break_sounds: bool = True
    break_start_sound: Optional[str] = None  # Path to WAV file
    break_end_sound: Optional[str] = None    # Path to WAV file
```

---

## Database Schema Changes

No schema changes needed. Uses existing:

- `ActionItem` table (existing)
- `WorkLog` table (existing in models.py)

WorkLog schema (already defined):

```python
@dataclass
class WorkLog:
    item_id: str              # References action_items.id
    started_at: str           # ISO datetime (local timezone)
    minutes: int              # Work time in minutes
    ended_at: Optional[str]   # ISO datetime (local timezone)
    note: Optional[str]       # Completion or next steps note
    id: str                   # UUID
    created_at: str           # ISO datetime (local timezone)
```

---

## Implementation Notes

1. **Timer Window**: Create new `TimerWindow` class inheriting from `CTkToplevel`
2. **File Location**: `src/getmoredone/screens/timer_window.py`
3. **Title Bar Color**: May need platform-specific code (Windows/Mac/Linux differ)
4. **Always On Top**: Use `window.attributes('-topmost', True)` for Tkinter
5. **Thread Safety**: Use `after()` for timer updates to avoid threading issues
6. **State Management**: Track timer state (stopped, running, paused, in_break)

---

## Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Time calculations (work time, break time, elapsed time)
   - State transitions (stop → start → pause → resume)
   - WorkLog data creation

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Finished flow: Timer → WorkLog → Complete Action
   - Continue flow: Timer → Complete → Duplicate → Next Day
   - Multiple pause/resume cycles

3. **Manual Tests**:
   - Window resizing and positioning
   - Title bar color changes
   - Always-on-top behavior
   - Cross-platform testing (if applicable)

---

## Implemented Enhancements (January 2026)

### FR-ENH-01: TODAY Screen New Item Button

**Status**: ✅ Implemented

**Description**: Added "+ New Item" button to TODAY screen for quick action creation.

**Implementation**:

- Green button positioned in header between title and Refresh
- Opens item editor dialog
- Location: `src/getmoredone/screens/today.py`

---

### FR-ENH-02: Continue Workflow Date Selection

**Status**: ✅ Implemented

**Description**: Enhanced Continue workflow with custom date selection for the next action.

**Implementation**:

- Created `NextStepsDialog` class with date pickers
- Users can set Start and Due dates for continued action
- Quick buttons: "Today" and "+1 day"
- Default: Tomorrow for both dates
- Validation: Due date must be >= Start date
- Dialog shows:
  - Next Steps Note textbox
  - Start Date entry with quick buttons
  - Due Date entry with quick buttons
  - Error label for validation messages
- Location: `src/getmoredone/screens/timer_window.py`

**Changes to Continue Flow**:

```python
# Old: Fixed tomorrow
new_item.start_date = tomorrow
new_item.due_date = tomorrow

# New: User-selected dates
new_item.start_date = next_steps_result['start_date']
new_item.due_date = next_steps_result['due_date']
```

---

### FR-ENH-03: Audio Alerts for Break Times

**Status**: ✅ Implemented

**Description**: Plays sounds when break starts and ends.

**Implementation**:

- Added audio settings to AppSettings:
  - `enable_break_sounds` (bool, default True)
  - `break_start_sound` (optional WAV path)
  - `break_end_sound` (optional WAV path)
- `play_sound(is_break_start)` method
- Cross-platform sound playback:
  - Windows: `winsound` module
  - macOS: `afplay` command
  - Linux: `aplay` command
- Fallback to system beep if custom sound fails
- Triggers:
  - Break start: When `work_seconds_remaining` reaches 0
  - Break end: When `break_seconds_remaining` reaches 0
- Location: `src/getmoredone/screens/timer_window.py`

---

### FR-ENH-04: Time Display Color

**Status**: ✅ Already Correct

**Description**: Time displays white normally, green when < 10 minutes.

**Current Behavior**:

```python
if self.work_seconds_remaining < self.settings.timer_warning_minutes * 60:
    color = "green"  # Warning color
else:
    color = "white"  # Normal color
```

No changes needed - already implemented as requested.

---

## Open Questions for Review

1. **Q**: Should the timer auto-start when window opens, or require clicking Start?
   - **Suggestion**: Require Start click for explicit user control

2. **Q**: What happens if user closes timer window without finishing?
   - **Suggestion**: Prompt "Save work log?" with Yes/No/Cancel options

3. **Q**: Can user edit time block duration after starting?
   - **Suggestion**: No editing during active session; restart required

4. **Q**: Should break time be optional per session?
   - **Suggestion**: Yes, show checkbox "Include break time" when starting

5. **Q**: What if action item has no planned_minutes set?
   - **Suggestion**: Prompt for time block duration before opening timer

6. **Q**: Should elapsed time include break time?
   - **Suggestion**: Yes, elapsed = total wall clock time from start to stop

7. **Q**: Break time title bar color - yellow/amber or different?
   - **Suggestion**: Amber/orange to distinguish from work (green warning)

8. **Q**: Can multiple timers run simultaneously for different actions?
   - **Suggestion**: No, enforce single active timer (prevents confusion)

# daVIPA User Guide

This guide explains what each screen, button, and workflow does, and why you might use it. It is aligned to the current UI and screen code in `src/getmoredone/screens`.

Last updated: 2026-06-06

## 1) What daVIPA is for

daVIPA is a desktop task manager focused on prioritization and execution.

- What: A single place to capture action items, assign priorities, and schedule work.
- Why: It helps you decide what to do next, track progress, and keep long-term planning connected to daily execution.

---

## 2) Core concepts

### List Views
- What: In this project, `List Views` refers specifically to the `Today`, `Upcoming`, `All Items`, and `Hierarchical` screens.
- Why: These four screens share list-style browsing, filtering, and row presentation patterns, so they are treated as one UI family in planning and implementation discussions.
- Layout note: The current List Views show `Title`, `SubSegment`, and `Category` as stable columns and keep `Immediate Step` readable as the window narrows; lower-priority columns compress first.

### Action Items (tasks)
- What: The central record you work with. Required fields: `Who` and `Title`.
- Why: A consistent structure makes filtering, scheduling, and prioritization reliable.

### Priority score
- What: Calculated as Importance x Urgency x Effort-Cost (Size) x Value.
- Why: A single number makes it easy to rank items and focus on the highest impact work.

### Dates
- What: Each item can have a Start Date and a Due Date.
- Why: Start dates help with scheduling; due dates help with deadlines.
- Rule: Due date is never earlier than start date.

### Planned minutes
- What: Your estimate for how long the item should take.
- Why: Powers time blocks, timer defaults, and planned vs actual stats.

### Status
- What: Items can be `open`, `completed`, or `canceled`.
- Why: Status controls what shows up on Today/Upcoming views and what counts toward stats.

### Contacts and Who
- What: Contacts are people/clients. The item `Who` field can link to a contact.
- Why: You can filter by Who and keep consistent naming across items.

### Links (Item Links)
- What: Attachments/URLs tied to an item (e.g., Obsidian notes, Google Calendar events).
- Why: Keeps the context for a task inside the task.

### Hierarchy (parent/child tasks)
- What: Any item can have child items.
- Why: Useful for breaking large work into smaller next actions.

### VSP (Vision Strategy Plan)
- What: A planning hierarchy from long-term vision down to weekly actions, grouped by life segment.
- Why: Connects long-term goals to day-to-day tasks.

## 3) Screen-by-screen guide (What + Why)

### Today
- What: Shows items scheduled for today, split into open and completed today.
- Why: A focused daily view of what matters right now.
- **Column headers & resizable Title** — What: A pinned heading row (Title, SubSegment, Category, Who, Start, Due, Pri, Time) stays put while the list scrolls. Drag the vertical divider at the right edge of the **Title** header to widen or narrow the Title column, spreadsheet-style; titles re-clamp with `…` as you drag. Why: Make room for long titles without losing the other columns. The width is remembered between sessions.

Header controls:
- **Search** — What: Searches title, description, and next action within Today scope. Why: Quickly find an item.
- **Expand/Collapse** — What: Toggles extra columns and priority factor chips. Why: Show or hide detail to reduce noise.
- **Top 3** — What: Shows only the top 3 open items by priority. Why: Focus on the highest priority work.
- **+ New Item** — What: Opens the Item Editor for a new task. Why: Capture work quickly.
- **Refresh** — What: Reloads the list. Why: Pull in updates after edits.

Row controls (open items):
- **Drag to top (pin)** — What: Each open row has a small drag handle (`⣿`) at its left edge. Drag it upward to pin the item above every other Today row. Why: Force a task to the top regardless of its priority score. The pin sticks (it survives edits, priority changes, and reschedules) and is independent of the calculated priority — dragging another item to the top puts that one above. Pinning affects the Today list only.
- **Complete checkbox** — What: Marks item completed. Why: Clear finished work and log progress.
- **Timer** — What: Opens the focused timer window. Why: Work in a time block and log actual time.
- **Edit** — What: Opens the Item Editor. Why: Adjust details or add context.
- **Quick date edit** — What: Click a row's **Start** or **Due** cell to open the inline date editor. Alongside `Today`, `-1`, and `Clear`, a **From today** row offers `+1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +10 +14` buttons that set the date to that many days from today (weekend-aware). Why: Reschedule in one click without typing a date.
- **Push** — What: Moves start/due dates forward by 1 day using weekend settings. Why: Reschedule quickly.

Completion feedback:
- **Completion badge** — What: Completed rows can show a large green check mark or a user-uploaded badge image. Why: Make completion more visible and customizable.
- **Confetti threshold** — What: Optional celebration every N completions in the current session. Why: Add lightweight positive feedback without changing completion logic.

### Upcoming
- What: Shows open items due within the next N days, grouped by date.
- Why: Plan and look ahead without losing overdue items.

Header controls:
- **Search** — What: Searches title, description, next action. Why: Find items fast.
- **Next N days** — What: Sets the lookahead window. Why: Match planning horizon.
- **Who** — What: Filters by Who. Why: Focus on a client or context.
- **Expand/Collapse** — What: Toggles extra columns and priority factor chips. Why: Show or hide detail.
- **+ New Item** — What: Opens the Item Editor. Why: Capture a new upcoming task.

Row controls (open items):
- **Timer** — What: Starts the timer window. Why: Execute the task in a focused block.
- **Edit** — What: Opens the Item Editor. Why: Update scheduling or details.
- **Push** — What: Moves start/due forward by 1 day (weekend-aware). Why: Reschedule quickly.

### All Items
- What: A table view of all items, with filters.
- Why: Full visibility across open, completed, and canceled items.

Header controls:
- **Search** — What: Searches title, description, next action. Why: Locate items quickly.
- **Status** — What: Filters by open/completed/canceled/all. Why: Narrow the list to the state you need.
- **Who** — What: Filters by Who. Why: Focus on a person or client.
- **Expand/Collapse** — What: Toggles extra columns and priority factor chips. Why: Show or hide detail.
- **+ New Item** — What: Opens the Item Editor. Why: Add a new item.

Row controls:
- **Complete checkbox** — What: Marks an open item completed. Why: Clear finished work.
- **Timer** — What: Starts a timer for open items. Why: Track actual work time.
- **Edit** — What: Opens the Item Editor. Why: Modify item details.

### Hierarchical
- What: Tree view of parent/child relationships.
- Why: Visualize complex tasks and their sub-items.

Header controls:
- **Search** — What: Searches items. Why: Find a node quickly.
- **Status** — What: Filters by open/completed/all. Why: Reduce tree noise.
- **+ New Item** — What: Creates a new item. Why: Add tasks from the hierarchy view.

Behavior:
- Without search: shows roots and children indented.
- With search: shows a flat list of matching items.

### Scheduler
- What: A drag-and-drop rescheduling view. Left side shows Action Items; right side shows Date Boxes and a Calendar tab.
- Why: Quickly drag tasks onto a specific date and reschedule in one move.

Header controls:
- **Next N days** — What: Sets how many date boxes to show. Why: Adjust your planning horizon.
- **Who** — What: Filters the left list by Who. Why: Focus on one client or context.
- **Segment / SubSegment** — What: Filters the Scheduler by APE lineage. Why: Focus scheduling on one planning area.
- **Refresh** — What: Reloads the full visible range using the current `Next N days` and `Who` filters and clears any clicked date filter. Why: Reset back to the full scheduling set.

Main area:
- **Action Items list (left)** — What: Open items with no dates plus upcoming items in the selected window. Why: A short list of items worth scheduling.
  - Columns: `(checkbox)`, `Title`, `Segment`, `SubSegment`, `Category`, `Start`
  - **Resizable columns** — What: Every data column (Title, Segment, SubSegment, Category, Start Date) has a draggable divider at its right edge; drag it to widen or narrow the column, spreadsheet-style. Cell text expands to fill the new width (so a wide Title shows the full title instead of "…"). Widths are remembered between sessions. Same reusable resizer as the Today view.
  - **Row checkbox** — What: A checkbox in the first column of each item row. Why: Select several items to move them together (see "Drag a group" below). Optional — leave them all unchecked to drag items one at a time.
- **Date Boxes (right)** — What: Drop targets for dates. Why: Reschedule by drag-and-drop.
  - Date box columns: `Day`, `Date`, `Items`, `Time`
  - Weekday names use the full day name.
  - Start-date color rule on the left list: overdue = red, today = green, future = yellow.
  - Date/future box height: controlled by setting (`Drag Schedule box height (px)`).
- **Next item rows (left)** — What: draggable source records. Why: schedule items quickly.
  - Row height: uses the same `Drag Schedule box height (px)` setting for visual alignment with right-side boxes.
- **Calendar tab** — What: Month-style calendar with clickable/drop-target day boxes. Why: Schedule by calendar instead of date list.
- **Projects tab** — What: A list of active project boxes. Why: Drag action items onto a project to link them.
  - Project box columns: Shows project title, planning lineage, and open item counts.
  - Row height: 50% larger than date boxes for prominence.
  - **No Project box** — What: A special box at the top of the project list. Why: See unlinked items or drag an item here to remove its project link.
- **Future options (bottom)** — What: `Next Month`, `Next Quarter`, `Near Term`, `Long Term` boxes. Why: Fast scheduling to common future anchors.

Drag behavior:
- **Drag onto Date** — What: Drag an item title onto a date box or calendar day. Why: Sets both Start Date and Due Date to the drop date.
- **Drag onto Project** — What: Drag an item title onto a project box. Why: Links the item to that project and synchronizes its planning lineage (APE).
- **Drag onto No Project** — What: Drag a linked item onto the "Unlinked" box. Why: Removes existing project links and clears planning lineage.
- **Drag a group (checkboxes)** — What: Check one or more item rows, then drag any *checked* row. Why: Every checked item moves together to the dropped date or project in one action. Dragging an *unchecked* row still moves just that one item, so single-item drag is unchanged. While dragging a group the drag label shows the count (e.g. "3 items").

Filtering behavior:
- **Click a date box or calendar day** — What: Filters the left list to that specific date. Why: Inspect what is already scheduled there.
- **Click a project box** — What: Filters the left list to show items linked to that project. Why: See the current project backlog.
- **Click the same date/project again** — What: Clears the filter. Why: Return to the full view quickly.
- **Project Sort** — What: Dropdown to sort projects by Title, Subsegment, or Category. Why: Find projects faster in long lists.
- **Refresh** — What: Reloads the full visible range and clears all active date/project filters. Why: Reset back to the full scheduling set.
- **Resize divider** — What: Drag the center divider between left and right panels. Why: Give more space to either the item list or the date/calendar/project panel.

### Projects
- What: A board of project notes, each linked to an Annual Plan Element (APE).
- Why: Gives you a visual project layer between planning and individual action items.

Board behavior:
- **Every project has an APE (required)** — What: A project must be linked to an Annual Plan Element; the editor defaults new projects to `Contribution - Projects - Projects` as a catch-all and refuses to save without an APE. Why: The APE supplies each project's Segment/SubSegment/Category lineage, which drives card color and the Scheduler's Segment/SubSegment filters.
- **Multiple projects may share one APE** — What: Several projects can point at the same APE (for example, many under the catch-all `Contribution - Projects - Projects`). Why: You are not limited to one project per planning element. APEs still auto-create a starter project note, but you can add more.
- **Color** — What: Note color comes from the APE category color. Why: Preserve planning lineage visually. If a card looks uncolored, its APE's category has no color set, or (on older data) the project had no APE — re-open the project, confirm the APE, and Save.
- **Top title** — What: Each note shows `SubSegment - Category`. Why: Keep the planning context visible at a glance.
- **Rank box** — What: A prominent number in the upper-left shows the board order position. Why: Make manual ordering obvious after dragging cards.
- **Body** — What: Shows the project title, full next step (bolded), and as many notes as will fit. Why: Keep strategic work visible on the board without manual setup.
- **Click a note** — What: Selects the note and loads its detail panel. Why: Prevent accidental opens while still supporting drag reordering.
- **Drag notes** — What: Reorders notes left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Why: Let you organize the board visually.
- **Board divider** — What: Drag the vertical divider between the board and detail panel. Why: Make the board wider or narrower.
- **Note Size slider** — What: Resizes all notes together. Why: Fit more notes on the board or make them easier to read.
- **Compact Height** — What: Reduces note height. Why: Fit more notes vertically.

Note actions:
- **Pencil** — What: Edit project (vertical yellow pencil with black tip and red eraser). Why: Update title, next step, notes, or status.
- **Plus** — What: Create and link a new action item. Why: Turn project planning into execution.
- **Page (📄)** — What: Opens a small chooser asking "Create New Obsidian Note" or "Link Existing Obsidian Note", which delegates to the same dialogs used for Action Item notes. Why: Make the natural reading of the icon ("add a note here") match its behavior.
- **Clock** — What: Set project note to Pending. Why: Hide it from the active board without deleting it.
- **Check mark** — What: Set project note to Completed. Why: Remove it from the active board when finished.
- **Trash can** — What: Delete the project note. Why: Remove obsolete project records when appropriate.

Filters:
- **Show Pending / Show Complete** — What: Toggles those note states onto the board. Why: Review inactive work without mixing it into the default active board.
- **Link Action Item button color** — What: In the detail panel, the button uses the Category color. Why: Keep the project-to-action workflow visually tied to planning lineage.

#### Project detail panel (right side)

The header above the two lists carries a **Time** line:

```
Time: 12 sessions | 8h 45m
```

That is every timer session logged against every action item filed under this
project — completed items and follow-ups included, since a follow-up inherits its
project link. It is counted from the session records themselves rather than kept
as a running total on the project, so it cannot drift out of step with them.

Not to be confused with the reward protocol's own counter, which counts
*completed deliverables* (Done presses) to decide how often you get a celebration
and carries no time at all. See "The reward protocol" below.

When you click a project on the board, the right side shows two stacked sections — Project Notes on top, Action Items below — with a shared filter above both.

- **Shared "Show Completed" checkbox** — What: A single toggle above both lists, default OFF. Why: First view shows only open Project Notes and open Action Items; flip it on to reveal completed work in both lists at once.

Project Notes section:
- **What it is** — Each row is an Obsidian note linked to this project. Project Notes have a Status (Open / Completed) but no priority and no dates.
- **Per-row buttons**:
  - **Open** — What: Opens the note in your Obsidian vault. Why: Read or edit the note.
  - **Complete** / **Reopen** — What: Flips the note's status. Why: Track whether a reference doc still needs attention.
  - **Unlink** — What: Removes the link from this project (does not delete the .md file). Why: Disassociate a note that no longer belongs.
- **Ordering** — Notes are shown most-recently-linked first.
- **Count label** — Reads "N note(s) shown" or "N shown • M completed hidden" when the shared filter hides completed notes.

Action Items section:
- **Select All checkbox** — What: Checks every visible action item row in one click. Why: Avoid clicking each row when planning a bulk change. Respects the shared Show Completed filter — only visible items are selected.
- **Per-item checkbox** — What: Selects a single action item. Why: Build an arbitrary selection for bulk edits.
- **Bulk Edit button** — What: Enabled when ≥1 item is selected; opens a small dialog. Why: Apply Start Date and/or Priority to several items at once.
  - **Start Date** — Future dates only (today or later). When set, Due Date is auto-set to Start Date + 1 day for every selected item.
  - **Priority** — Any importance value, or "(Skip)" to leave each item's existing priority untouched.
  - **Field preservation** — Leaving a field blank / on "(Skip)" preserves the existing value for every selected item; only the fields you fill in change.
- **Edit / Complete / Unlink** — Per-row controls work as before.

#### Toolbar buttons (right panel)
- **Create Action Item** — Add a new task to this project.
- **Link Action Item** — What: Opens the Link Action Items dialog to attach existing tasks to this project. Why: Pull already-created items onto a project so they pick up its planning lineage.
  - **Search** — Filter by title, description, next step, or who.
  - **Filter buttons (AND logic)** — `Completed`, `Not Completed`, `Linked`, `Not Linked`. What: Toggle any combination; active filters highlight and all selected filters must match (e.g. `Not Completed` + `Not Linked` shows only open tasks not yet on any project). Why: Narrow a long task list to exactly the items you want to link.
  - **Per-row checkbox + Link Selected** — What: Check several rows and click **Link Selected** to attach them all at once; the per-row **Link** button still links one item. Why: Bulk-link a batch without clicking each row.
  - Linking an item also stamps the project's APE onto it, so it becomes filterable by Segment/SubSegment in the Scheduler.
- **Bulk Edit** — See above; enabled when items are selected.
- **Edit Project** — Open the project editor dialog.
- **Create Note** / **Link Note** — Create a new Obsidian note (lands in your Project Notes Folder) or link an existing one.
- **Open Notes** — Browse the project's linked notes in a separate dialog (kept for explicit "show me the notes I have" use).

- **APE Weekly** — Work weekly parent records and their daily child Action Items.

Deletion protection (child records):
- **Delete a Vision Element** — What: Blocked when child records still exist (annual plan records, attached projects, or linked action items). A dialog lists what is attached and tells you to delete or reassign those child items first. Why: Prevent a single delete from silently cascading away annual records and projects.
- **Delete an Annual Plan record (APE)** — What: Blocked when projects are attached to that APE — either more than its starter project note, or any project that has linked action items. The dialog lists the attached projects. Why: Now that multiple projects can share one APE, deletion must not destroy projects you parked there; delete or reassign them first.

APE assignment behavior:
- **Checkbox + Save** — What: The assignment screens still support explicit checkbox selection and save. Why: Keep the existing bulk workflow available.
- **Drag and drop** — What: The APE screens also support dragging left-side records onto the right-side assignment panel. Why: Speed up planning when working item by item.

- **Create weekly assignments** — What: Check month-assigned APEs on the left and click `Save`, or drag a left-side row onto the right panel. Why: Mirrors the same assignment pattern used by Year → Quarter and Quarter → Month screens.
- **Weekly tactic actions** — What: Edit, delete, or create a related Action Item from a selected weekly tactic on the right. Why: Keep weekly planning and execution steps close together.
- New daily item title format: `Weekly Title Prefix - Action Item Title`.
- Prefix shortening rule: first two pipe-delimited parts become initials.
  - Example: `Purposeful Work|Living Systems|Blog` → `PW|LS|Blog`.

## 4) Item Editor (What + Why)

The Item Editor is where you create and edit Action Items. It appears from **+ New Item** and **Edit** buttons.

Main fields:
- **Who** — What: Person, client or context the item belongs to. Start typing and
  matching Contacts drop down; picking one links the item to that contact. On a *new*
  item, changing Who also re-applies that person's Defaults to any field you have left
  empty (priority factors, group, category, planned minutes, date offsets) — it never
  overwrites something you have already set, and it does nothing on an existing item.
  Why: Filter and group items by owner, and get sensible defaults per client.
- **Title** — What: The task name, in full. Why: The primary label everywhere in the app.
  (The separate **Context** box in front of Title has been removed — it was never a field
  of its own, only the front half of this same title. Titles are unchanged; the whole
  title now lives in, and saves from, this one box.)
- **Description** — What: Longer notes. Why: Store context or details.
- **Next Action** — What: Short, action-focused notes, often one per line. Why: Break a task into next steps.
- **Deliverable** — What: The crisp "done = ..." for this item, in one line. A checkable
  artifact, not a time-box: *"Draft section 2's opening paragraph"*, never *"work on the
  report for 25 min"*. Why: It is what the Timer's reward protocol is contingent on. If
  you leave it blank here, the Timer asks for one when you start a session on an item
  that belongs to a Project — so it is only ever optional, never skipped where it counts.
- **Planned Minutes** — What: Time estimate. Why: Better scheduling and stats.

Action Plan (top left):
- **Project** — What: The Project Board this item is filed under. Why: See at a glance where
  the item sits in your plan, without opening a tab. Set it with **Set Project**.
- **Wk Tactic** — What: The Weekly Tactic the item is filed under. Why: Same, for the week.
  Set it with **Set Wk Tactic**.
- **Orig. Week** — What: The week the item was originally meant to start. Why: A task pushed
  out repeatedly still shows where it began.
- **Depth** — What: How much focus this task needs — Deep, Medium, or Shallow. Why: Set
  on the Priority tab; echoed here so the whole scheduling picture is visible at once.
- **Work Block** — What: The time-box to schedule on the calendar (90, 60, or 30 minutes).
  Why: A ready duration for the calendar button.

Tabs:

Dates:
- **Start Date** — What: When work should start. Why: Schedule intentionally.
- **Due Date** — What: Deadline. Why: Keep commitments visible.
- **Today / -1 / +1 / Clear** — What: Quick date controls. Why: Fast scheduling.
- **Is Meeting** — What: Meeting flag. Why: Track meeting tasks and calendar links.
- **Meeting Time** — What: Auto-filled from Calendar events. Why: Keep meeting time visible.

Priority:
- **Importance, Urgency, Effort-Cost, Value** — What: Priority factors. Why: Compute priority score and compare items.
- **Depth** — What: How much focus this task needs (Deep, Medium, Shallow). Why: Match the task to your energy.
- **Work Block** — What: The time-box to schedule (90, 60, or 30 minutes). Why: A ready duration for scheduling.
- **Schedule on Calendar** — What: Opens the calendar event dialog for this item, with its Duration pre-filled from Work Block. Why: Put the work block on your calendar from the same tab.

Organization:
- **Group, Category** — What: Organizational labels. Why: Filter and report by area.
- **Status / Completed Date** — What: Item state. Why: Control workflow and visibility.

  (The Weekly Tactic and Orig. Week fields moved from this tab to the Action Plan block in
  the top left, alongside the Project.)

Notes:
- **+ Create Note** — What: Creates an Obsidian note for the item. Why: Keep longer notes linked.
- **+ Link Note** — What: Links an existing Obsidian note. Why: Connect existing context.
- **Open** — What: Opens a linked note. Why: Jump to details quickly.
- **Remove (X)** — What: Unlinks the note. Why: Clean up attachments.

Buttons (top row):
- **Save & Close** — What: Saves and closes. Why: Finish editing quickly.
- **Save** — What: Saves changes, keeps editor open. Why: Iterate without reopening.

Buttons (paired below):
- **Timer** — What: Opens the focus timer for this item. Why: Work in tracked sessions.
- **Cancel** — What: Closes without saving. Why: Discard changes.
- **Add Follow-up** — What: Saves your edits, then creates a follow-up item seeded from this
  one — inheriting its Project and Weekly Tactic. Why: Continue work without losing history.
  (This replaces the old separate **Duplicate** button; a follow-up is a copy that also keeps
  the link back to the original.)
- **Add Subtasks** — What: Creates one child item per line in Next Action. Why: Quickly split work.
- **Set Parent** — What: Assigns a parent item. Why: Organize tasks into a tree.
- **Show Related** — What: Shows parent and children. Why: Navigate the hierarchy.
- **Set Wk Tactic** — What: Files the item under a Weekly Tactic. Why: Tie daily work to the week's plan.
- **Set Project** — What: Files the item under a Project Board — and can create a new Project on
  the spot with **+ New Project**. Why: Create a task and the project it belongs to without
  leaving the editor. **Clear Project** unfiles it. Not available on a Weekly Tactic record.
- **Complete** — What: Marks the item completed. Why: Track progress.
- **Delete** — What: Deletes the item (children are preserved). Why: Remove obsolete tasks.
- **Save + New** (new items only) — What: Saves and opens a new item. Why: Rapid entry of multiple tasks.

Note: filing an item under a Project also stamps that project's Annual Plan Element onto the
item, and clearing the project clears it — the same rule as dragging an item onto a project in
the Scheduler.

## 5) Timer window (What + Why)

The Timer supports focused work sessions and time tracking.

The window has three areas: the **timer**, the **music**, and the **session actions**.

Timer area:
- **Deliverable** — What: What this session is for, shown at the top with an **Edit**
  button. Why: It is what the reward is contingent on, so it is on screen the whole time
  rather than typed once into a dialog and never seen again. If the item has no
  deliverable, starting the timer asks for one; if it already has one, you are not asked
  again — you can see it, and edit it if it changes.
- **Time Block** — What: Total minutes for the session. Why: Set a time boundary.
- **Time To Finish** — What: Countdown of work time. Why: Keep pace.
- **Wrap/Break** — What: Break duration. Why: Account for wrap-up time.
- **▶ Start / ⏸ Pause / ⏹ Stop** — What: The transport, laid out like a recorder and
  sitting inside the timer area. Why: They belong to the clock they drive.
- **Done — deliverable complete** — What: Marks the deliverable finished and closes out the
  session. Available the whole time a session is running, not only when the clock stops.
  Why: Finishing the thing is what ends the work; the clock running out is not.

At the end of a break the timer no longer stops on its own. It asks:
- **Pause (rest)** — What: Stops the clock and waits. Resume starts a fresh focus block.
- **Continue focus** — What: Straight into another block, no interruption.

Neither of these completes anything. That is the point: the reward has to fire on
finishing a deliverable, never on the timer ringing, or what gets reinforced is sitting
there until the bell goes.

Two things follow from that. **Music keeps playing through the end of a break** — it
used to stop, because the break ending used to stop the whole timer. It now behaves the
way it does when you Pause: yours to control, from the music buttons. And the **session
actions are one click further away at the ring** — press Stop to reach them, or press
Done if the deliverable is actually finished.

Music area:
- **▶ Play** — What: Starts music from your configured folder. Why: Focus support.
  **Music never starts on its own.** Starting the timer used to start the music too,
  which decided for you that this was a session with music in it.
- **⏸ Pause** — What: Pauses music. Why: Quiet when needed.
- The track name and any reason music could not start appear here, in the music area —
  not on the timer's own status line.

Session actions (after **Stop**):

A timer session is a *record of work on* an action item, not the item's ending. These
three say what they do:

- **Save Related - Close Timer** — What: Prompts for a session note, saves the session
  as a related record against the action item along with the time spent, and returns you
  to the action item, which stays **open**. Why: The ordinary ending — you did some work,
  it is written down, the task is not finished.

**Session Notes.** All three endings that record a session — *Done*, *Save Related* and
*Complete & Create Follow Up* — ask for a note in a window called **Session Notes**. What
you type is appended to the **description** of the action item you were working on,
prefixed with the date:

```
what this task is for

08-25: got the opening paragraph down
08-26: sent the draft to Legal
```

Notes accumulate rather than replacing each other, and Skip adds nothing. The note is also
stored on the session record itself, but nothing in the app displays those yet — the
description is where you read them back. On *Complete & Create Follow Up* the note goes on
the **original** item, not the follow-up, because it describes the session that just
happened.
- **Cancel Timer** — What: Closes the timer and returns you to the action item with
  **nothing recorded**. No session, no time, no note, and no change to the item — not
  even notes you typed into this window. Why: Cancel means nothing happened. If you want
  the time kept, use *Save Related - Close Timer* instead.
- **Complete & Create Follow Up** — What: Completes the *timer session* — saves it as a
  related record against the action item — then creates a follow-up item and opens it for
  you to fill in. The action item itself stays **open**. The follow-up is titled
  *"<original title> - Follow up MM-DD"* — the day it was made, which is what tells two
  follow-ups of one item apart. It starts with *"Add your next steps and set the dates and
  priority"* in its description, and inherits the original item's start and due dates, its
  project, its weekly tactic and its links — so an item that was already late produces a
  follow-up that is already late. Change the dates in the editor it opens. Why: Ending today's block on work that continues, with the
  next step already written down beside it.

**Only one of these five buttons closes a task.** "Complete" in *Complete & Create Follow
Up* means the timer session is complete, not the work:

| Button | Task closed? | Counts towards the reward phase? |
|---|---|---|
| **Done — deliverable complete** | yes | **yes** |
| **Complete & Create Follow Up** | no — it opens the follow-up beside it | no |
| **Save Related - Close Timer** | no | no |
| **Cancel Timer** | no — nothing is recorded at all | no |
| **Stop** | no — it just stops the clock | no |

So **"Done" is the only button that closes a task or counts a completed deliverable**
towards a project's phase. *Complete & Create Follow Up* leaves today's item open: it
records the session and gives you the next step to work on, and you close the item with
*Done* when the work is actually finished.

One exception, by design: if you press **Done** and saving fails (a locked database, say),
your completion is remembered so it is not lost — press *Done* again to record it.
*Complete & Create Follow Up*, *Save
Related* and *Cancel Timer* deliberately do not — they say the task is still open, so they
discard the pending completion rather than banking it for a task they are leaving
unfinished.

The old buttons were called *Finished* and *Continue*, and both quietly completed the
item and closed the window, which looked from the outside like pressing them did nothing
at all.

Notes:
- **Pop Out** — What: Opens the notes in a separate window. Why: More space to write.
- **Save Notes** — What: Saves edits to the item description. Why: Keep notes synced.

### The reward protocol (items filed under a Project)

Starting a timer on an item that belongs to a Project asks you to confirm its
**Deliverable** first, prefilled from the item. Cancelling does not start the timer —
a tracked session with no deliverable has nothing to be contingent on. Items **not**
filed under a Project run the timer exactly as they always have, with none of this.

When you press **Done**:

1. **Savor.** A short prompt naming what you set out to do, confirming it is done, and
   asking you to look at it for five seconds and notice the effort. Early in a project
   this appears on *every* completed deliverable — that is how the association gets
   built. After fifteen completed deliverables on that Project it drops to roughly two
   in five, because something that happens every single time stops telling you anything.
2. **Celebration.** About one completion in five, at random, in either phase: confetti,
   balloons, or a short chime. Never guaranteed, and never *instead of* the savor step.
3. The Project's completed-deliverable count goes up — every time, whether or not the
   savor prompt appeared — and the session is written to your work log along with which
   deliverable it was for and what the protocol did.

Nothing here says "well done". The words point at the thing you made and at the effort
of making it, which is what the whole design is for.

## 6) Calendar dialog (What + Why)

The Calendar dialog schedules a Google Calendar event and links it to an item.

Fields:
- **Event Title** — What: Calendar event title. Why: Clear meeting name.
- **Date** — What: Meeting date with Today and +1 buttons. Why: Quick scheduling.
- **Start Time** — What: Hour/minute/AM-PM. Why: Exact start time.
- **Duration** — What: Minutes. Why: Accurate calendar blocks.
- **Description** — What: Event details. Why: Add context.
- **Location** — What: Meeting location. Why: Keep logistics visible.
- **Attendees** — What: Comma-separated emails. Why: Invite participants.

Buttons:
- **Create Calendar Event** — What: Creates the event and links it to the item. Why: Keep tasks and calendar connected.
- **Cancel** — What: Closes dialog without changes. Why: Back out safely.

---

## 7) Common workflows (Why you would use them)

- **Daily focus**: Today screen + Top 3 to focus on the highest priority items.
- **Weekly planning**: Upcoming and Scheduler to place tasks on dates.
- **Time blocking**: Plan screen to translate tasks into a daily schedule.
- **Meetings**: Item Editor + Calendar dialog to schedule and link meetings.
- **Hierarchy**: Next Action + Create Tasks to break down large projects.
- **Review**: Completed and Stats to review progress and time accuracy.

---

## 8) Data location and backups

Default locations:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/GetMoreDone/getmoredone.db`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\GetMoreDone\getmoredone.db`

These paths keep the app's previous name, `GetMoreDone`, on purpose — changing
them would leave the app looking for your data somewhere it was never written.

Development mode:
- Set `GETMOREDONE_DB=/path/to/your/dev/getmoredone.db`
- `start.sh` defaults to `./data/getmoredone.db`

Backups:
- Use **Settings → Database Management → Backup Database** to create a timestamped backup next to your current DB file.

## Appendix: Glossary

- **Who**: Person/client/context the item is for.
- **Planned minutes**: Your estimated duration for the task.
- **Work log**: A record created by the Timer when you finish or continue.
- **Item link**: A stored URL/reference tied to an item (Obsidian note, Google Calendar event, etc.).
- **VSP Segment**: A life area bucket for VSP planning.

# Third-Party Notices

daVIPA incorporates the third-party components listed below. Each remains
under its own licence, which governs that component. Nothing in `LICENSE`
limits any right those licences grant you.

Every entry was read from the installed distribution's own package metadata, not
from memory. `tests/test_release_licensing.py` fails if a dependency is added to
`requirements.txt` without a notice here.

## pygame — LGPL notice and relink statement

daVIPA links **pygame**, which is distributed under the GNU Lesser General
Public Licence (LGPL), version 2.1. A verbatim copy of that licence — the one
pygame itself ships — is distributed inside every release archive:

- macOS: `daVIPA.app/Contents/Resources/licenses/pygame-LGPL-2.1.txt`
- Windows: `licenses\pygame-LGPL-2.1.txt`, beside `daVIPA.exe`

It is also available at https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html

In accordance with that licence, daVIPA is distributed in **one-folder**
form rather than as a single self-extracting executable, so that pygame's
libraries remain separate, replaceable files. You may replace the pygame
libraries inside the application folder with a modified or different compatible
version and continue to run daVIPA.

- macOS: `daVIPA.app/Contents/Resources/pygame/`
- Windows: `daVIPA\_internal\pygame\`

This packaging choice is enforced by
`tests/test_packaging_resources.py::test_rm1d_spec_uses_onefolder_not_onefile`,
so it cannot be changed to `--onefile` without a test failing.

pygame is used only for optional background-music playback during timer
sessions. No audio files are distributed with daVIPA; you supply your own
music folder in Settings.

## Fonts, icons, and audio

No third-party fonts or audio files are distributed with daVIPA. Icons in
`assets/` are the copyright holder's own work.
